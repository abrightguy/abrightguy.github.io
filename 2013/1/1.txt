A current building standard conflicts with pertinent statute(s). To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must cite the subject building standard and the conflicting statute(s), and provide a clear written description of why the two are inconsistent.

2.
Compliance with a current building standard is routinely impossible or onerous. To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must cite the current building standard, present written or photographic evidence of the difficulty in complying with it, and clearly show that the problem is common or potentially common to many different projects or project types in many different circumstances. This criterion shall not be used to justify a petition for the repeal or amendment of a current building standard that poses difficulty to a single project.

3.
A current building standard is inefficient or ineffective. To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must cite the subject building standard, provide clear and concise written or photographic evidence of its ineffectiveness or inefficiency, describe a proposed alternative, and provide clear and convincing written or photographic evidence that it is more efficient or effective.

4.
A current building standard is obsolete. To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must show at least one of the following facts:


A. A material or product specified in the building standard is not available, or
B. There is no statute authorizing the subject building standard, or
C. Significant developments in procedures, materials or other issues subject to the building standard have created a need for amendment or deletion of the building standard; that current state statutes permit amendment or deletion of the building standards; and that the building standard has the effect of prohibiting the use of a material or procedure that has demonstrated satisfactory performance and meets the intended purpose of building standards.
5. 	There is a need for a new building standard. To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must provide a clear written description of the proposed building standard, explain why it is necessary, and cite the statute(s) that require or authorize the new building standard.
