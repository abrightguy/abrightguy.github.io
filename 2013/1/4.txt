ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS FOR THE DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT-STRUCTURAL SAFETY (DSA-SS)
which have been prepared by others shall assume responsibility for the safety of design of the completed construction and for the interpretation of and any necessary amplification of the plans and specifications of the project. He/she shall stamp and sign all plans submitted for approval to indicate his/her assumption of responsibility or may in lieu thereof, stamp and sign, and submit plans prepared under his/her own charge. (See Section 4-210 for other signatures.) When an architect, structural engineer or civil engineer accepts the responsibility for completion ofa project or a portion of a project relinquished by another, that architect, structural engineer or civil engineer thereby assumes responsibility as follows:
1.
If the relinquishment occurs prior to the completion of the design documents, all responsibility shall be assumed. [See Section 4-225 (c) for the procedure.]

2.
If the relinquishment occurs after the design drawings and specifications have been completed and approved by the enforcement agency, the assuming architect or registered engineer shall be responsible for the construction of the project in accordance with the design of the relinquishing architect or engineer.

(a) General. After DSA has completed its review of the documents submitted with the application, the checked prints of the plans and specifications with the requests for corrections and/or additional information noted thereon shall be returned to the responsible architect or registered engineer. When plans and/or specifications require extensive corrections, a corrected set of prints of the plans and specifications shall be submitted for review if requested by DSA.
When the requested corrections have been made and/or the additional information as requested has been provided by the responsible architect or registered engineer, an employee representative of the architect or registered engineer shall return the check set ofplans and specifications along with the original plan tracings, the corrected specification pages and specification master cover sheet to DSA for backchecking. The backcheck is a comparison ofthe corrected plans and specifications with the check set of plans and specifications and shall be accomplished either by a conference at the DSA office between the architect or registered engineer or his/her employee representative and the checking engineer or by mail in the case of minor corrections to which all parties have agreed.
Changes in plans and specifications, other than changes necessary for correction, made after submission for approval shall be brought to the attention of DSA in writing or by submission ofrevised plans identifying those changes clearly at the time of back-checking. Failure to give such notice may result in the voidance of any subsequent approval given to the plans and specifications.
All requested corrections shall be made, additional requested information furnished or original designs justified and a list of materials to be tested and special inspections to be made shall be supplied to DSA at the time ofbackcheck. When DSA deems that the corrected plans and specifications comply with these regulations and all parts of Title 24, CCR, that pertain to essential services building construction, DSA shall place its stamp of identification on the reproducible sheets of drawings and master cover sheet of the specifications. This stamp is affixed for purposes of identification only and shall not be construed as authorization to let the construction contracts.
One set of prints of the stnmped plans and specifications shall be submitted to DSA. The submittal of the stamped prints of the plans and specifications is required before DSA will issue the written notice of approval of the application.
(b) Approval of the application. DSA shall issue to the owner of the essential services building a letter approving the application for the project upon receipt of the stamped copies of the approved plans and specifications. This letter shall constitute the approval of drawings and specifications as required by Section 16016 of the Health and Safety Code. No contract for construction shall be let or approved by the owner of the essential services building and no monies shall be spent for construction work on an essential services building project until this approval in writing has been had and obtained.
DSA will retain one set of the stamped plans and specifications and other pertinent project information in its files as a permanent record of the compliance of the approved project documents.
(c) Voidance of the application. Any change, erasure, alteration or modification of any plans or specifications bearing the identification stamp of DSA may result in voidance of the approval of the application. However, the "written approval of plans" may be extended by DSA to include revised plans and specifications after documents are submitted for review and approved. (See Section 4-233 for revised plans and Section 4-215 for addenda and change orders.)
The procedures leading to written approval of plans shall be carried to conclusion without suspension or unnecessary delay. The application shall be void where either (1) prints from corrected plans or corrected original plans are not filed for backcheck and the backcheck is not completed within six months after the date ofreturn ofthe checked plans to the architect or registered engineer, or (2) prints of the stamped plans and one set of the stamped specifications are not submitted to DSA files within two months after the date shown on the stamp of identification.

Existing school buildings for which a reconstruction, alteration or addition project is proposed shall be evaluated, and retrofitted as required to comply with currently effective regulations applicable to the rehabilitation of structural systems per Section 4-306, includ-II ing wind and seismic force requirements, when any of the following conditions occur:
1. 	When the cost of the reconstruction, alteration, or addition project exceeds $25,000 and 50 percent of the replacement value of the existing building. Maintenance work and air-conditioning equipment and insulation materials costs need not be included in the percentage of replacement value calculation. For the purposes of this
section, the cost of the reconstruction, alteration or addition project shall not include the cost of voluntary lateral force-resisting system modifications in accordance with Section 4-309(d). If these voluntary lateral force-resisting system modification costs are to be excluded and the structure is located in a fault hazard zone, a geologic hazard report shall be prepared demonstrating that the structure is not located within 50 feet of the trace of an active
fault as defined in Section 4-317(e), otherwise these costs shall be included.
2. 	When the cost of the reconstruction, alterations or addition project exceeds $25,000 but does not exceed 50 percent ofthe replacement value of the existing building and the proposed modifications, either:
A. Increase the effective seismic weight or wind force in any story by more than 10 percent, or;
B. Decrease the design capacity of any existing structural component by more than 5 percent, unless the component has the capacity to resist the retrofit design forces.
3. When a change of occupancy results in a structure being II reclassified to a higher risk category.
Ifthe base shear capacity has been increased since the original construction, the percent change in base shear is permitted to be calculated relative to the increased capacity.
(d)
Voluntary lateral force-resisting system modifications. Alterations to existing structural components or additions of new structural components that do not exceed the limitations of Section 4-309(c)2 and are initiated for the purpose of increasing the strength or stiffness of the lateral forceresisting system of an existing structure are permitted to be evaluated and designed in accordance with Section 3417.11 of Part 2, Title 24, for voluntary lateral force-resisting system modifications.

4-316. Designation of responsibilities.
(a) General responsible charge. For every project there shall be an architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge of the preparation of the plans, specifications and observation of the work of construction, except that where plans, specifications or work of construction for alterations or repairs do not involve architectural or structural changes said plans, specifications and observation of the work of construction may be under the responsible charge of a professional engineer qualified to perform services and registered in that branch of engineering applicable to the work.
A project may be divided into parts, provided that each part is clearly defined by a building or similar distinct unit. The part, so defined, shall include all portions and utility systems or facilities necessary to the complete functioning of that part. Separate assignments of general responsible charge may be made for the parts.
(b) Delegation of responsibility. The architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge may delegate responsibility for any portion of the work to, or may employ or retain, other architects or registered engineers. No delegation to, or employment or retention of others shall be construed as relieving the architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge of his or her rights, duties and responsibilities under Sections 17302 and 81138 of the Education Code and Sections 4-336, 4-341 and 4-344 of these regulations. Whenever an engineer or architect has accepted delegation for the design of portions of the plans and specifications, that same engineer or architect shall observe the construction of the same portions of the design.
Subject to the provisions of the immediately precedent sentence, the architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge shall employ or retain, under his or her supervision, professional engineers registered in the applicable branches of engineering to design and observe the construction, including the making of verified reports (see Section 4-336), of the mechanical and electrical portions ofthe work, but this requirement for observation of construction may be waived by DSA II when special mechanical and electrical inspection is provided.
(c) Assumption of responsibility. The architect or registered engineer who submits for approval plans and specifications for any project or portion of a project which have been prepared by others shall assume responsibility for the safety of design of the completed construction and for the interpretation of and any necessary amplification of the plans and specifications of the project. The responsible architect or engineer shall stamp and sign all original tracings or all copies of plans submitted for approval to indicate his or her assumption of responsibility or may in lieu thereof stamp and sign and submit plans prepared under his or her own charge. [See Section 4-317 (h) for other signatures.j
When an architect or registered engineer accepts the responsibility for completion of a project or portion of a project started by another, that architect or registered engineer thereby assumes responsibility as follows:
1.
Ifthe change in responsibility occurs prior to the completion of the design documents, all responsibility shall be assumed. (See first paragraph of this subsection for procedure.)

2.
If the change in responsibility occurs after the design drawings and specifications have been completed and approved by DSA, the assuming architect or registered engineer shall be responsible for the construction of the project in accordance with the design of the previous architect or engineer. The assuming architect or registered engineer shall assume responsibility for the interpretation of and any necessary amplification of the plans and specifications and shall stamp and sign any such documents prepared for that purpose.


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
(d) Acceptance of responsibility. The assumption of gen

eral responsible charge or of delegated responsibility shall be reported using the form(s) prescribed by DSA. Any change in the assumption of the general responsible charge or of delegated responsibility shall be reported using the form(s) prescribed by DSA. Ifno form is available for a specific delegation or change, the delegation of responsibility shall be reported in letter form, which shall include an indication that the school board has been notified.
(e)
Evidence of responsibility. The stamp and signature of the architect or registered engineer on a plan, specification or other document shall be deemed evidence that full responsibility is assumed by the signatory for the work shown thereon, including also those portions of the accompanying computations, specifications or plans which pertain to such work, unless express notice of disclaimer of responsibility is given in writing to DSA prior to the approval of the plans and specifications.

(f)
Alternates. The applicant, or the architect or registered engineer having general or delegated responsibility, may name one or more persons to act as alternate(s) for the design and/or observation of the work ofconstruction, provided such persons are architects or registered engineers who themselves are qualified under these rules and regulations to assume the responsibility assigned.


II
Alternates may be named on a form prescribed by DSA, or in
letter form. Letters or forms shall be submitted to DSA prior to performance of work by the alternate and shall include an indication that the school board has been notified.

Failure to comply with the established de11dline may result in voidance ofthe application.
Plans and specifications which when submitted are determined by DSA to be incomplete or incorrect, shall be returned
SAFETY OF CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS

to the architect or engineer in general responsible charge with a request for compliance with these regulations before checking is started by DSA.
(b) Plans. Plans shall designate the use or occupancy of all parts of the school buildings and shall give such other information as may be required to indicate the nature of the work proposed and to show compliance with the act and these regulations. The plans shall be legible and sufficiently detailed and cross-referenced to show clearly the pertinent features of the construction, and shall have sufficient dimensions to be readily interpreted. Where a project includes several school buildings, the plans for each shall be drawn independently except that details common to all need not be repeated.
The architect or engineer in general responsible charge or the professional engineer delegated responsibility for the design of the structural system of the project shall design and detail the anchorage and bracing of nonstructural elements. The details for the bracing and anchorage of nonstructural elements shall be shown on the drawings adjacent to the nonstructural elements to which they apply.
(c) Specifications. Specifications shall completely set forth the requirements for the various types of materials that will enter into permanent construction and shall describe the methods not covered in the technical regulations which are to be used to obtain the required quality of the work shown on the plans as described in the specifications.
Due to the difficulty of anticipating every unsatisfactory condition that might be found in existing construction where addition, alteration, rehabilitation or reconstruction work is proposed, the following clause or one of similar meaning shall be included in the specifications:
"Should any existing conditions such as deterioration or non-complying construction be discovered which is not covered by the DSA approved documents wherein the finished work will not comply with Title 24, California Code of Regulations, a construction change document, or a separate set ofplans and specifications, detailing and specifying the required repair work shall be submitted to and approved by DSA before proceeding with the repair work."
(d) Design calculations. Calculations, stress diagrams and other pertinent data shall accompany the plans and specifications and shall be sufficiently complete so that capacities for individual structural members and their connections can be verified without additional calculations. All assumptions used in the calculations and their bases shall be stated. The calculations shall be prefaced by a statement clearly and concisely outlining the basis for the structural design and indicating the manner in which the proposed school building will resist verticalloads and horizontal forces.
The calculations shall be sufficiently complete to establish that the structure will resist the loads and forces prescribed in Part 2, Title 24, C.C.R. Assumed safe bearing pressures on soils and specified strengths ofconcrete shall be given in calculations and noted on plans. Where unusual conditions occur, such additional data as are pertinent to the work shall be submitted.
(e) Site data. Site data for all school sites shall include a geotechnical engineering report including subsurface site work, laboratory testing, an evaluation of site soil conditions, a recommendation for the type of foundations to be used and an allowable design value for the soil-bearing capacity.
A geologic and earthquake hazard report shall be submitted with the application for all new school sites, and for all construction on existing school sites located in a Seismic Hazard Zone, an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, or in a seismic hazard zone designated in the Safety Element of a Local General Plan. DSA may require a geologic and earthquake hazard study for any construction on a school site outside of the boundaries of any geologic hazard zone where a potential geologic hazard has been previously identified.
Reports shall be prepared, and signed by a California-certified engineering geologist and a California-registered geotechnical engineer. Geologic hazard reports shall include an evaluation of the potential for damage due to flooding.
No school building shall be constructed, rehabilitated, reconstructed or relocated within 50 feet of the trace of an active fault, which has experienced surface displacement within Holocene time (approximately 11,000 years).
(f) Estimates of cost. Estimates ofcost shall be based on the cost prevailing at the time the plans and specifications are submitted to DSA. The estimated cost of a project shall be increased as necessary to include the estimated cost of every alternate building or portion thereof shown on the plans or specifications as if each alternate building and portion were to be constructed separately and simultaneously.
For projects using the collaborative process for project review per Education Code Section 17319 or 81133.1, the estimated cost ofthe project shall be based on the cost prevailing at the time that the application is submitted. Upon submittal of complete plans and specifications, DSA may require the applicant to revise the estimated cost based on prevailing costs at that time. If the estimated cost has increased, the applicant shall submit additional filing fees based on the revised estimated cost.
When a contract amount, or the cumulative total of two or more contract amounts, exceeds the estimated cost by more than 30 percent, the estimated cost may be revised. An additional fee, ifrequired, based on the revised estimated cost of the revision shall be paid before proceeding with the work. When the actual cost of constructing all the work shown on the approved plans is less than 70 percent of the estimated cost, a refund of overpaid fees may be claimed. (See Section 4-322 for actual cost and Section 4-325 for billing for further fees.)
II (g) Deferred submittals. Only where a portion of the construction cannot be adequately detailed on the approved plans because of variations in product design and/or manufacturer, the approval of plans for such portion, when specifically accepted by DSA, may be deferred until the material suppliers are selected, provided the following conditions are met:
II
1. The project plans clearly indicate that DSA approval of
the deffered submittal is required for the indicated por
tions of the work prior to fabrication and installation.
2. The project plans and specifications adequately describe the performance and loading criteria for such work.
3. 	A California licensed architect or California registered engineer stamps and signs the plans and specifications for the deferred submittal item. The architect or engineer II in general responsible charge of the design of the project shall submit the plans and specifications for the deferred submittal item to DSA, with notation indicating that the
II

deferred submittal documents have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building.
4. Fabrication of deferred submittal items shall not begin II without first obtaining the approval of plans and specifications by DSA.
(h) Signatures required. The original signature sheet for the specifications and all plans, submitted for approval shall < bear the stamp and signature of the architect or professional engineer in general responsible charge of the design of the project.
When responsibility for a portion of the work has been delegated, the plans and the original cover sheet for the specifica-< tions covering that portion ofthe design shall bear the signature and stamp of the responsible professional engineer or architect to whom the work has been delegated as well as that of the architect or engineer in general responsible charge. As an option, the architect or engineer in general responsible charge may sign the documents with notation indicating that the documents have been coordinated with the design documents and found to be in general conformance with the design.

HISTORY:
I. 	(OSNSS 1/92) Regular order by the Office ofthe State Architect/Structural Safety Section to amend Section 4-317, Part!, Title 24, C.C.R. Filed with the Secretary of State on December 15, 1992; effective July 1, 1993. Approved by the California Building Standards Commission on December 9, 1992.
4-318. Procedure for approval of application and voidance of application.
(a) General. After DSA has completed its check of the documents submitted with the application, the checked prints of the plans and specifications, with the items marked for corrections and/or requests for additional information noted thereon, shall be returned to the responsible architect or registered engineer. When plans and/or specifications require extensive corrections, a corrected set of prints of the plans and specifications shall be submitted for review if requested by DSA.
When the requested corrections have been made and/or the additional information has been provided by the responsible architect or registered engineer, an employee representative of the architect or registered engineer shall return the check set of plans and specifications along with the original plan tracings, the corrected specification pages and specification master cover sheet to DSA for backchecking. The backcheck is a comparison of the corrected plans and specifications with the check set of plans and specifications and shall be accomplished by either a conference between a knowledgeable employee representative or the architect or registered engineer in general responsible charge and the checking engineer, or by mail in the case of minor corrections to which all parties have agreed.
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

Changes in plans and specifications, other than changes necessary for correction, made after submission for approval, shall be brought to the attention of DSA in writing or by submission ofrevised plans identifying those changes clearly at the time of back-checking. Failure to give such notice may result in the voidance of any subsequent approval given to the plans and specifications.
All requested corrections shall be made, additional requested information furnished or original design justified prior to or at the time ofthe backcheck. When DSA deems that the corrected plans and specifications comply with these regulations and those parts of Title 24, CCR, that pertain to public school construction, DSA shall place its stamp on the reproducible sheets of drawings and master cover sheet of the specifications. The stamped drawings and specifications will be temporarily retained by DSA so that a record set can be created. DSA may charge a fee to the school district to recover the costs of creating the record set.
(b)
Approval of application. DSA shall issue to the school district a letter approving the application for the project within five working days of stamping the approved plans and specifications. This letter shall constitute the "written approval of the plans, as to safety ofdesign and construction" required by Sections 17297 and 81134, Education Code, before letting a contract for any construction. (See Section 4-330 for construction time limitations.)

(c)
Voidance of application. Any change, erasure, alteration or modification of any plans or specification bearing the stamp of DSA may result in voidance of the approval of the application. However, the "written approval of plans" may be extended by DSA to include revised plans and specifications after documents are submitted for review and approved. (See Section 4-323 for revised plans and Section 4-338 for addenda and construction changes.)


The procedures leading to written approval of plans shall be carried to conclusion without suspension or unnecessary delay. At the discretion of DSA, the entire application may be voided where either (1) prints from corrected plans or corrected original plans are not filed for backcheck within 6 months after the date of return of checked plans to the architect or engineer, or (2) at the discretion of DSA, any remaining unapproved increment(s) of the application may be voided when more than six months have elapsed since the last approval of an increment has been issued, and subsequent incremental plans and specifications have not been received by DSA for checking.
