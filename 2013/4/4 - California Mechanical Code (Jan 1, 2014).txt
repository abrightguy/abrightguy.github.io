PREFACE 



This document is the 4th of 12 Parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building Standards Code. Part 4 is known as the California Mechanical Code and incorporates, by adoption, the 2012 edition of the Uniform Mechanical Code of the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials with the California amend­0 ments. 
·0 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legislature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various State agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building regula­tions or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipulated. The 
California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 
A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the localcondition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effective sooner than the effective date of this edition of California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and appli­cable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing. 
To familiarize yourself with the format of this code, it is suggested that users review the following contents: 

• How To Distinguish Model Code Language From California Amendments; and 
• Matrix Adoption Tables

UMC FOREWORD 
Not Adopted by The State of California 


The Uniform Mechanical Code® (UMC®) provides complete requirements for the installation and maintenance of heating, ventilating, cooling, and refrigeration systems, while at the same time allowing latitude for innovation and new technologies. 
This code was first published in 1967. With the publication of the 2003 edition of the Uniform Mechanical Code®, another 
0

significant milestone was reached. For the first time in the history of the United States, a mechanical code was developed through a true consensus process. The 2012 edition represents the most current approaches in the mechanical field and is the fourth edition developed under the ANSI Consensus process. Contributions to the content of this code were made by every segment of the built industry, including such diverse interests as consumers, enforcing authorities, installers/maintainers, insur­ance, labor, manufacturers, research/standards/testing laboratories, special experts, and users. 
0 The public at large is encouraged and invited to participate in IAPMO's open consensus code development process. This code is updated every three years. A code development timeline and other relevant information is available at IAPMO's website at www.iapmo.org. 
The Uniform Mechanical Code® is dedicated to all those who, in working to achieve "the ultimate mechanical code," have unselfishly devoted their time, effort, and personal funds to create and maintain this, the finest mechanical code in existence today. 
The 2012 Uniform Mechanical Code® is supported by the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA), Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors National Association (PHCC-NA), the United Association (UA), and the World Plumbing Council (WPC). The presence of these logos, while reflecting support, does not imply any ownership of the copyright to the UMC which is held exclusively by IAPMO. Further, the logos of these asso­ciations indicates the support ofiAPMO's open, consensus process being used to develop IAPMO's codes and standards.

size reduction] and those exceeding 12 inches (305 mm) in diameter are not reduced exceeding two table sizes [e.g., 24 inches to 20 inches (610 mm to 508 mm) is a two-size reduction]. 
(2) 	
The fan-assisted appliances are common vented with a draft hood-equipped appliance. 

(3) 	
The vent connector has a smooth interior wall. [NFPA 54: 13.2.24] 


803.2.21 Combination of Pipe Types and Sizes. 
Combinations of pipe sizes, single-wall, and double-wall metal pipe shall be allowed within a connector run or within the common vent, provided the appropriate tables permit the desired sizes and types of pipe, as where they were used for the entire length of the subject connector or vent. Where single-wall and Type B double-wall metal pipes are used for vent connectors within the same venting system, the common vent shall be sized in accor­dance with Table 803.1.3(8) or Table 803.1.3(10). [NFPA 
54: 13.2.25] 

803.2.22 Multiple Connector and Vent Sizes. Where a table permits more than one diameter of pipe to be used for a connector or vent, all the permitted sizes shall be permitted to be used. [NFPA 54: 13.2.26] 
803.2.23 Interpolation. Interpolation shall be permitted in calculating capacities for vent dimensions that fall between table entries. (See Example 803.2.23) [NFPA 
54: 13.2.27] 

Example 803.2.23: Interpolating between Table Values. An installer has an 80 000 Btu/h (23.4 kW) input appliance with a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter draft hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 12 foot (3658 mm) high Type B vent. The vent connector has a 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral length and is also Type B. Is this appliance permitted to be vented using a 4 inch (1 02 mm) diameter vent? 
Solution: 

Table 803.1.3(1) is used in the case of an all Type B vent system. However, since there is no entry in Table 803.1.3(1) for a height of 12 foot (3658 mm), interpola­tion shall be used. Read down the 4 inch (102 mm) diam­eter NAT Max column to the row associated with a 10 foot (3048 mm) height and 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral to fmd the capacity value of77 000 Btu/h (22.6 kW). Read further down to the 15 foot ( 4572 mm) height, 5 foot (1 524 mm) lateral row to fmd the capacity value of 87 000 Btu!h (25.5 kW). The difference between the 15 foot ( 4572 mm) height capacity value and the 10 foot (3048 mm) height capacity value is 10 000 Btu/h (3 kW). The capacity for a vent system with a 12 foot (3658 mm) height is equal to the capacity for a 10 foot (3048 mm)height plus two-fifths of the difference between the 10 foot (3048 mm) and 15 foot (4572 mm) height values, or 77 000 (22.6 kW) + ¥s X 10 000 Btu!h (3 kW) = 81 000 Btu/h (23 . 7 kW). Therefore, a 4 inch (1 02 mm) diameter vent shall be used in the installation. [NFPA 54:G.l.3] 





2013 CALIFORNIA MECHANICAL CODE 

803.2.24 Extrapolation. Extrapolation beyond the table entries shall not be pennitted. [NFPA 54: 13.2.28] 
803.2.25 Engineering Methods. For vent heights lower than 6 feet (1829 mm) and exceeding vent heights shown in the tables, engineering methods shall be used to calcu­late vent capacities. [NFPA 54: 13.2.29] 
803.2.26 Height Entries. Where the actual height of a vent falls between entries in the height column of the applicable table in Table 803.1.3(7) through Table 
803 .1.3(15), either: 

(1) 	
Interpolation shall be used. 

(2) 	
The lower vent capacity shown in the table entries shall be used for FAN MAX and N.tXr MAX column values and the higher vent capacity shall be used for the FAN MIN column values. [NFPA54-12:13.2.30]

STEAM AND HOT WATER BOILERS 
FOOTNOTES FOR TABLE 1011.1 (continued) 
1 	Fuel input shall be determined by one of the following: 
(1) 
The burner input shall not exceed the input shown on the burner nameplate or as otherwise identified by the manufacturer. 

(2) 
The nominal boiler rating, as determined by the building official, plus 25 percent. 2 


Automatic boilers shall have one flame failure device on each burner, which shall prove the presence of an ignition source at the point where it will ignite the main burner, except that boiler groups A, B, E, F, and G, which are equipped with direct electric ignition, shall monitor the main burner, and boiler groups using interrupted pilots shall monitor the main burner after the prescribed limited trial and ignition periods. Boiler group A, equipped with continuous pilot, shall accomplish 100 percent shutoff within 90 seconds upon pilot flame failure. The use of intermittent pilots in boiler group C is limited to approved burner units. 
3 	In boiler groups B, C, and D a 90 second main burner flame failure limit shall be permitted to be applied where continuous pilots are provided on manufac­turer assembled boiler-burner units that have been approved by an approved testing agency in accordance with nationally recognized standards approved by the building official. Boiler groups F and G equipped to re-energize their ignition systems within 0.8 second after main burner flame failure will be permitted 30 seconds for group F or 15 seconds for group G to re-establish their main burner flames. 
4 	Boiler groups C and D shall have controls interlocked to accomplish a nonrecycling fuel shutoff upon high or low gas pressure, and boiler groups F, G, and H using steam or air for fuel atomization shall have controls interlocked to accomplish a nonrecycling fuel shutoff upon low atomizing steam or air pressure. Boiler groups F, G, and H equipped with a preheated oil system shall have controls interlocked to provide fuel shutoff upon low oil temperature. 
5 Automatic boilers shall have controls interlocked to shut off the fuel supply in the event of draft failure where forced or induced draft fans are used or, in the event of low combustion airflow, where a gas power burner is used. Where a single motor directly driving both the fan and the oil pump is used, a separate control is not required. 
6 Boiler groups C, D, and H, where firing in excess of 400 000 Btu/h ( 117 kW) per combustion chamber, shall be provided with low fire start of its main burner system to permit smooth light-off. This will normally be a rate of one-third of its maximum firing rate.

valve installed to admit the standby supply and at the same 
time shut off the regular supply shall be permitted to be used 
for this purpose. [NFPA 54:5.3.2] 

1318.0 Required Gas Supply. 
1318.1 General. The following regulations shall comply with 
this section and Section 1319.0, shall be the standard for the I 

installation of gas piping. Natural gas regulations and tables 
are based on the use of gas having a specific gravity of 0.60, 
supplied at 6 to 8 inches water column (1.5 kPa to 1.9 kPa) 
pressure at the outlet of the meter or regulator. For undiluted I 
liquefied petroleum gas, gas piping shall be permitted to be 
sized at 11 inches water column (2.7 kPa) pressure at the 
outlet of the meter or regulator and specific gravity of 1.50. 

Where gas of a different specific gravity is to be deliv­ered, the serving gas supplier shall be permitted to be contacted for specific gravity conversion factors to use in sizing piping systems from the pipe sizing tables in this chapter. 
1318.2 Volume. The hourly volume of gas required at each piping outlet shall be taken as not less than the maximum hourly rating as specified by the manufacturer of the appli­ance or appliances to be connected to each such outlet. 
1318.3 Gas Appliances. Where the gas appliances to be installed have not been definitely specified, Table 1308.4.1 shall be permitted to be used as a reference to estimate requirements of typical appliances. To obtain the cubic feet per hour (m3/h) of gas required, divide the input of the appli­ances by the average Btu (kW· h) heating value per cubic foot (m3) of the gas. The average Btu (kW·h) per cubic foot (m3) of the gas in the area of the installation shall be permitted to be obtained from the serving gas supplier. 
1318.4 Size of Piping Outlets. The size of the supply piping 
outlet for a gas appliance shall be not less than Yz of an inch (15 mm). 
The size of a piping outlet for a mobile home shall be not less than % of an inch (20 mm).

1319.0 Required Gas Piping Size. 1319.1 Pipe Sizing Methods. Where the pipe size is to be determined using a method in Section 1319.1.1 through Section 1319.1.3, the diameter of each pipe segment shall be obtained from the pipe sizing tables in Section 1319.2 or from the sizing equations in Section 1319.3. [NFPA 54:6.1] 1319.1.1 Longest Length Method. The pipe size of each section of gas piping shall be determined using the longest length of piping from the point of delivery to the 
most remote outlet and the load of the section. [NFPA 54:6.1.1] 1319.1.2 Branch Length Method. Pipe shall be sized 
as follows: 
(
1) 	The pipe size of each section of the longest pipe run from the point of delivery to the most remote outlet shall be determined using the longest run of piping and the load of the section. 

(2) 	
The pipe size of each section of branch piping not previously sized shall be determined using the length of piping from the point of delivery to the most remote outlet in each branch and the load of the section. [NFPA 54:6.1.2] 


1319.1.3 Hybrid Pressure. The pipe size for each section of higher pressure gas piping shall be determined using the longest length of piping from the point of delivery to the most remote line pressure regulator. The pipe size from the line pressure regulator to each outlet shall be determined using the length of piping from the regulator to the most remote outlet served by the regu­lator. [NFPA 54:6.1.3] 
1319.2 Tables for Sizing Gas Piping Systems. Table 1319 .2( 1) through Table 1319 .2(36) shall be used to size gas piping in conjunction with one of the methods described in Section 1319.1.1 through Section 1319.1.3. [NFPA 54:6.2] 
1319.3 Sizing Equations. The inside diameter of smooth wall pipe or tubing shall be determined by Equation 
1 1319.3(1), Equation 1319.3(2), Table 1319.3, and using the equivalent pipe length determined by Section 1319.1.1 through Section 1319.1.3. [NFPA 54:6.4]

1319.4 Sizing of Piping Sections. To determine the size of each section of pipe in a system within the range of Table 1319.2(1) through Table 1319.2(36), proceed as follows: I 
(1) 	
Measure the length of the pipe from the gas meter loca­tion to the most remote outlet on the system. 

(2) 	
Select the length in feet column and row showing the distance, or the next longer distance where the table does not give the exact length. 

(3) 	
Starting at the most remote outlet, fmd in the just selected the gas demand for that outlet. Where the exact figure of demand is not shown, choose the next larger figure in the row. 

(
4) 	At the top of the column in the table will be found the I correct size of pipe. 

(
5) Using this same row, proceed in a similar manner for each section of pipe serving this outlet. For each section of pipe, determine the total gas demand supplied by that section. Where gas piping sections serve both heating and cooling appliances and the installation prevents both I units from operating simultaneously, the larger of the two 

demand loads needs to be used in sizing these sections. 

(6) 	
Size each section of branch piping not previously sized

Upon completion of the installation, alter­ation, or repair of process piping, and prior to the use thereof, the Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be notified that such piping is ready for inspection. Excavations required for the installation of underground piping shall be kept open until such time as the piping has been inspected and approved. Where such piping is covered 

or concealed before such approval, it shall be exposed upon the direction of the Authority Having Jurisdiction. 1405.2 Required Inspections. The Authority Having Juris­

diction shall make the following inspections and shall either approve that portion of the work as completed or shall notify the permit holder wherein the same fails to be in accordance with this code. 
1405.2.1 Rough Piping Inspection. This inspection shall be made after process piping authorized by the permit has been installed and before piping has been covered or concealed. This inspection shall include a determination that the piping size, material, and installa­tion are in accordance with the requirements of this code. 


1405.2.2 Final Piping Inspection. This inspection shall be made after piping authorized by the permit has been installed and after portions thereof that are to be covered or concealed are so concealed. This inspection shall include a pressure test, at which time the piping shall stand a pressure of not less than one-and-one-half times the maximum designed operating pressure where hydraulic testing is conducted or 110 percent where testing is conducted pneumatically. Test pressures shall be held for a length of time satisfactory to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, but in no case for less than 30 minutes with no perceptible drop in pressure. HPM drain, waste, and vent piping shall be tested in accordance with the plumbing code. Tests shall be made in the presence of the Authority Having Jurisdiction. Necessary apparatus for conducting tests shall be furnished by the permit holder. 
1405.3 Other Inspections. In addition to the inspections required by this section, the Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be permitted to require a special inspector, as specified in the building code, during installation of piping systems. In cases where the work authorized was installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, the Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be permitted to require a final signed report stating that the work was installed in accor­dance with approved plans and specifications and the appli­cable provisions of this chapter. 
1406.0 Piping and Tubing.

[ASHRAE 90.2: TABLE 6.5] 


For SI Units: °C= ("F-32)/1.8, 1 British thermal unit inch per hour square foot degree Fahrenheit= [0.1 W/(m•K)], 1 inch= 25 mm 


Notes: 
1 For insulation outside the stated conductivity range, the minimum thickness (1) shall be determined as follows: 
T= r{(1 + tlr)'>rlk-1} 
Where: 
T = minimum insulation thickness (inches). 

r = actual outside radius of pipe (inches) (mm). 
t = insulation thickness listed in this table for applicable fluid temperature and pipe size. 
K = conductivity of alternate material at mean rating temperature indicated for the applicable fluid temperature [Btu·in!(h•ftl•°F)] [W/(m•K)]. 
k = the upper value of the conductivity range listed in this table for the applicable fluid temperature. 

2 	These thicknesses are based on energy efficiency considerations only. Additional insulation is sometimes required relative to safety issues/surface temper­ature. 
3 
Piping insulation is not required between the control valve and coil on run-outs where the control valve is located within 4 feet (1219 mm) of the coil and the pipe size is 1 inch (25 mm) or less. 4 These thicknesses are based on energy efficiency considerations only. Issues such as water vapor p=eability or surface condensation sometimes require vapor retarders, additional insulation or both. 5 For piping exposed to outdoor air, increase insulation thickness by \12 of an inch (12.7 mm). The outdoor air is defmed as any portion of insulation that is exposed to outdoor air. For example, attic spaces and crawlspaces are considered exposed to outdoor air.

In most applications, the indi­vidual variable air valve (VA V) boxes serving each space will modulate the amount of air delivered to the space based on heating and cooling requirements. As a result, the total supply airflow provided by the central air handling unit shall vary to maintain sufficient airflow through each VA V box. Airflow shall be controlled using a variable frequency drive (VFD) to modulate supply fan speed and vary system airflow.

E 805.10 Hydronic System Variable Flow Controls (Form MECH-10A). The purpose of this test is to ensure that hydronic variable flow chilled water and water-loop heat pump systems with circulating pumps larger than 5 hp (3. 7 kW) vary system flow rate by modulating pump speed using a variable frequency drive (VFD) or equivalent. As the loads 


2013 CALIFORNIA MECHANICAL CODE 
within the building fluctuate, control valves modulate the amount of water passing through each coil and add or remove the desired amount of energy from the air stream to satisfy the load. In the case of water-loop heat pumps, each two-way control valve associated with a heat pump will be closed where that unit is not operating.

E 805.13.2 Acceptance Criteria. The system is able to detect common faults with air-handling units, such as a sensor failure, a failed damper, an actuator, or an improper operating mode. 
The system is able to detect and report common faults with zone terminal units, such as a failed damper, an actuator, or a control tuning issue. 
E 805.14 Distributed Energy Storage DX AC System (Form MECH-14A). The purpose of this test is to verify the proper operation of distributed energy storage DX systems. Distributed energy systems (DES) reduce peak demand by operating during off peak hours and storing cooling, usually in the form of ice. During peak cooling hours the ice is melted to avoid compressor operation. The system typically consists of a water tank containing refrigerant coils that cool the water and convert it to ice. As with a standard direction expansion (DX) air conditioner, the refrigerant is compressed in a compressor and then cooled in an air-cooled condenser. The liquid refrigerant then is directed through the coils in the water tank to make ice or to air handler coils to cool the building. This applies to constant or variable volume, direct expansion (DX) systems with distributed energy storage (DES/DXAC). 
E 805.14.1 Test Procedure. The procedure for performing a functional test for distributed energy storage DX AC systems shall be in accordance with Section E 805.14.1.1 through Section E 805.14.1.3.

E 805.15 Thermal Energy Storage (TES) System (Form MECH-15A). The purpose of this test is to verify the proper operation of thermal energy storage (TES) systems. TES systems reduce energy consumption during peak demand periods by shifting energy consumption to nighttime. Opera­tion of the thermal energy storage compressor during the night produces cooling energy which is stored in the form of cooled fluid or ice in tanks. During peak cooling hours the thermal storage is used for cooling to prevent the need for chiller operation. This section is limited to the following types of TES systems: 
(1) 	
Chilled water storage 

(2) 	
Ice-on-coil 

(3)

(1) 	
Final chiller efficiency (kW/ton) during 



charging. E 805.15.1.2 Functional Testing. The functional testing shall comply with the following steps: 
Step 1: Verify that the TES system and the chilled water plant is controlled and monitored by an energy management system (EMS). 
Step 2: Force the time to be between 9:00 p.m. and 
9:00a.m., and simulate a partial or no charge of the tank. Simulate no cooling load by setting the indoor temperature setpoint(s) higher than the ambient temperature. 
Where the tank is full or nearly full of ice, it shall be permitted to adjust the control settings for this test. In some cases, the control system will not permit the chiller to start the ice-making process unless a portion of the ice has been melted. The controls designer shall be permitted to use an inven­tory meter (a 4-20 rnA sensor that indicates water level) to determine whether or not ice-making can commence (e.g., not allow ice-making unless the inventory meter signal is less than 17 rnA). Where this is the case, this limit can be reset to 20 rnA during testing to allow ice making to occur. 
Verify that the TES system starts charging (storing energy). This shall be checked by verifying flow and inlet and outlet temperatures of the storage tank, or directly by reading an inventory meter where the system has one. 
Step 3: Force the time to be between 6:00p.m. and 
9:00 p.m., and simulate a partial charge on the tank. Simulate a cooling load by setting the indoor temperature setpoint lower than the ambient temper­ature. verify that the TES system starts discharging. 


This shall be checked by observing tank inlet and outlet temperatures and system flow, or directly by reading an inventory meter where the system has one. Where the system has no charge, verify that the system will still attempt to meet the load through storage. 
Step 4: Force the time to be between noon and 6:00 p.m., and simulate a cooling load by lowering the indoor air temperature setpoint below the ambient temperature. Verify that the tank starts discharging and the compressor is off. 
Step 5: Force the time to be between 9:00 a.m. to noon, and simulate a cooling load by lowering the indoor air temperature setpoint below the ambient temperature. Verify that the tank does not discharge and the cooling load is met by the compressor. 
Step 6: Force the time to be between 9:00 p.m. and 
9:00 a.m. and simulate a full tank charge. This can be done in a couple of ways: 
(1) 
By changing the inventory sensor limit that indicates tank capacity to the energy manage­ment system so that it indicates a full tank. 

(2) 
By resetting the coolant temperature that indi­cates a full charge to a higher temperature than the current tank leaving temperature. Verify that the tank charging is stopped. 


Step 7: Force the time to be between noon and 6:00 
p.m. and simulate no cooling load by setting the indoor temperature setpoint above the ambient temperature. Verify that the tank does not discharge and the compressor is off. 
E 805.15.2 Acceptance Criteria. Thermal energy 
storage (TES) system acceptance criteria shall be as 
follows:

VENT DESIGN TABLES 

F 1.1 Example 1: Single Draft Hood-Equipped Appliance. 
An installer has a 120 000 British thermal units per hour (Btu/h) (35 kW) input appliance with a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter draft hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 1 0 foot (3048 mm) high Type B vent system. What size vent should be used assuming: (1) a 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral single-wall metal vent connector is used with two 90 degree 
(1.57 rad) elbows or (2) a 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral single­wall metal vent connector is used with three 90 degree (1.57 rad) elbows in the vent system? (See Figure F 1.1) 
Solution: 
Table 803.1.3(2) shall be used to solve this problem because 
single-wall metal vent connectors are being used with a Type 
B vent, as follows:

Read down the first column in Table 803.1.3(2) until the row associated with a 10 foot (3048 mm) height and 5 foot (1 524 mm) lateral is found. Read across this row until a vent capacity exceeding 120 000 Btu/h (35 kW) is located in the shaded columns labeled NM Max for draft hood-equipped appliances. In this case, a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter vent has a capacity of 122 000 Btu/h (35. 7 kW) and shall be permitted to be used for this applica­tion. 

(2) 	
Where three 90 degree (1.57 rad) elbows are used in the vent system, the maximum vent capacity listed in the tables shall be reduced by 10 percent. This implies that the 5 inch (127 mm) diameter vent has an adjusted capacity of only 110 000 Btu/h (32 kW). In this case, the vent system shall be increased to 6 inches (152 mm) in diameter. See the following calculations: 



122 000 Btu/h (35.7 kW) X 0.90 = 110 000 Btu/h (32 kW) 
for 5 inch (127 mm) vent 
From Table 803.1.3(3), select 6 inch (152 mm) vent. 
186 000 Btu!h (54.5 kW) X 0.90 = 167 000 Btu/h (49 kW) 

This figure is exceeding the required 120 000 Btu/h (35 kW). Therefore, use a 6 inch (152 mm) vent and connector where three elbows are used. 


For SI units: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1000 British thermal units per hour = 0.293 kW

EXAMPLE 1 


F 1.2 Example 2: Single Fan-Assisted Appliance. An installer has an 80 000 Btu/h (23.4 kW) input fan-assisted appliance that shall be installed using 10 feet (3048 mm) of lateral connector attached to a 30 foot (9144 mm) high Type B vent. Two 90 degree (1.57 rad) elbows are needed for the installation. Is a single-wall metal vent connector permitted to be used for this application? (See Figure F 1.2) 


Solution: Table 803.1.3(2) refers to the use of single-wall metal vent connectors with Type B vent. In the first column find the row associated with a 30 foot (9144 mm) height and a 10 foot (3048 mm) lateral. Read across this row, looking at the FAN Min and FAN Max columns, to find that a 3 inch (76 mm) 
diameter single-wall metal vent connector is not recom­mended. Moving to the next larger size single-wall connector 4 inch (102 mm), we find that a 4 inch (102 rnm) diameter single-wall metal connector has a recommended maximum vent capacity of 144 000 Btu/h (42 kW). The 80 000 Btu/h 
(23.4 kW) fan-assisted appliance is outside this range, so the conclusion is that a single-wall metal connector shall be used to vent the appliance. Table 803.1.3(2) shows the acceptable range of vent capacities for a 4 inch (102 mm) vent with 5 feet (1524 mm) oflateral to be between 72 000 Btu/h (21.1 kW) and 157 000 Btu/h (46 kW). 
Where the appliance cannot be moved closer to the vertical vent, then a Type B vent shall be used as the connector material. In this case, Table 803.1.3(1) shows that, for a 30 foot (9144 mm) high vent with 10 feet (3048 mm) of lateral, the acceptable range of vent capacities for a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter vent attached to a fan-assisted appliance is between 37 000 Btu/h (10.8 kW) and 150 000 Btu/h (44 kW). 


For SI units: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1000 British thermal units per hour = 0.293 kW

F 1.3 Example 3: Interpolating Between Table Values. An installer has an 80 000 Btu/h (23.4 kW) input appliance with a 4 inch ( 102 mm) diameter draft hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 12 foot (3658 mm) high Type B vent. The vent connector has a 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral length and is also Type B vent. Is this appliance permitted to be vented using a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter vent? 


2013 CALIFORNIA MECHANICAL CODE 

Solution: 
Table 803.1.3(1) is used in the case of an all Type B Vent system. However, since there is no entry in Table 803.1.3(1) for a height of 12 feet (3658 mm), interpolation shall be used. Read 
down the 4 inch (102 mm) diameter NJXf Max column to the row associated with a 10 foot (3048 mm) height and 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral to fmd the capacity value of 77 000 Btulh 
(22.6 kW). Read further down to the 15 foot ( 4572 mm) height,5 foot ( 1524 mm) lateral row to find the capacity value of 87 000 Btu!h (25.5 kW). The difference between the 15 foot (4572 mm) height capacity value and the 10 foot (3048 mm) height capacity value is 10 000 Btulh (3 kW). The capacity for a vent system with a 12 foot (3658 mm) height is equal to the capacity for a 10 foot (3048 mm) height plus two-fifths of the differ­ence between the 10 foot (3048 mm) and 15 foot (4572 mm) height values, or 77 000 Btu/h (22.6 kW) + Ys x 10 000 Btu/h (3 kW) 81 000 Btu/h (23.7 kW). Therefore, a 4 inch (102 
= 
mm) diameter vent shall be used in the installation. 
F 2.0 Examples Using Common Venting Tables. F 2.1 Example 4: Common Venting Two Draft Hood­Equipped Appliances. A 35 000 Btu/h (10.3 kW) water heater is to be common vented with a 150 000 Btu/h (44 kW) furnace, using a common vent with a total height of 30 feet (9144 mm). The connector rise is 2 feet (610 mm) for the water heater with a horizontal length of 4 feet (1219 mm). The connector rise for the furnace is 3 feet (914 mm) with a horizontal length of 8 feet (2438 mm). Assume single-wall metal connectors will be used with Type B vent. What size connectors and combined vent should be used in this instal­lation? (See Figure F 2.1) 
Solution: Table 803.1.3(8) shall be used to size single-wall metal vent connectors attached to Type B vertical vents. In the vent 
connector capacity portion ofTable 803.1.3(8), find the row associated with a 30 foot (9144 mm) vent height. For a 2 foot ( 61 0 mm) rise on the vent connector for the water heater, read 
the shaded columns for draft hood-equipped appliances to find that a 3 inch (76 mm) diameter vent connector has a capacity of37 000 Btu/h (10.8 kW). Therefore, a 3 inch (76 mm) single-wall metal vent connector shall be used with the water heater. For a draft hood-equipped furnace with a 3 foot (9 14 mm
) rise, read across the row to find that a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter vent connector has a maximum capacity of 120 000 Btu!h (35 kW) (which is too small for the furnace), and a 6 inch (152 mm) diameter vent connector has a maximum vent capacity of 172 000 Btu/h (50 kW). Therefore, a 6 inch (152 mm) diameter vent connector shall be used with the 150 000 Btu/h (44 kW) furnace. Since both vent connector hori­zontal lengths are less than the maximum lengths listed in Section 803.2.1, the table values shall be used without adjust­ments. 



In the common vent capacity portion of Table 803.1.3(8), find the row associated with a 30 foot (9144 mm) vent height and read over to the NJXf + NJXf portion of the 6 inch (152

Btu/h (19.6 kW) and is equal to the draft hood outlet diameter. A4 inch (102 mm) vent connector is selected. Since the water heater is equipped with a draft hood, there are no minimum input rating restrictions. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion ofTable 803.1.3(8), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm) and across the 3 feet (914 mm) Connector Rise (R) row. Since the furnace has a fan-assisted combustion system, find the first FAN Max column with a Btulh rating exceeding the furnace input rating. The 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector has a maximum input rating of 119 000 Btu/h (34.9 kW) and a minimum input rating of 85 000 Btu/h (24.9 kW). 
The 100 000 Btu/h (29 kW) furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4 inch (102 mm) connector shall be permitted. Since the furnace vent connector horizontal length of 6 feet (1829 mm) is less than the maximum value listed in Section 803.2.1, the venting table values shall be used without adjustment. Where the furnace had an input rating of 80 000 Btu/h (23.4 kW), then a Type B vent connector shall be needed in order to meet the minimum capacity limit. [See Table 803.1.3(7)] 
Common Vent Diameter. The total input to the common vent is 135 000 Btu/h (40 kW). Using the Common Vent Capacity portion of Table 803.1.3(8), read down the Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm) and across this row to find the smallest vent diameter in the FAN + NAT column that has a Btu/h rating equal to or exceeding 13 5 000 Btu/h ( 40 kW). The 4 inch (102 mm) common vent has a capacity of 132 000 Btu/h (39 kW) and the 5 inch (127 mm) common vent has a capacity of202 000 Btulh (59 kW). Therefore, the 5 inch (127 mm) common vent shall be used in this example. 
Summary: In this example, the installer shall use a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter, single-wall metal vent connector for the water heater and a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter, single-wall metal vent connector for the furnace. The common vent shall be a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter Type B vent.

APPENDIX F 
F 2.3 Example 5(b): Common Venting into an Interior Masonry Chimney. In this case, the water heater and fan­assisted furnace of Example 5(a) are to be common-vented into a clay-tile-lined masonry chimney with a 30 foot (9144 mm) height. The chimney is not exposed to the outdoors below the roof line. The internal dimensions of the clay tile liner are nominally 8 inches (203 mm) by 12 inches (305 mm).Assuming the same vent connector heights, laterals, and materials found in Example 5(a), what are the recommended vent connector diameters, and is this an acceptable installa­tion? 
Solution: 
Table 803.1.3(10) is used to size common venting installations 
involving single-wall connectors into masonry chimneys. 

Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 803.1.3(10), Vent Connector Capacity, read down the Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm), and read across the 
2 feet (6 10 mm) Connector Rise (R) row to the first Btu/h rating in the NAT Max column that is equal to or exceeding the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3 inch (76 mm) vent connector has a maximum input of 31 000 Btu/h (9 kW), while a 4 inch (1 02 mm) vent connector has a maximum input of 57 000 Btu/h (16.7 kW). A 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector shall be used. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 803.1.3(10), read down the total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm) and across the 3 feet (914 mm) Connector Rise (R) row. Because the furnace has a fan-assisted combustion system, find the first FAN Max column with a Btu/h rating exceeding the furnace input rating. The 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector has a maximum input rating of 127 000 Btu/h (37 kW) and an input rating of not less than 95 000 Btu/h (27.8 kW). The 100 000 Btulh (29 kW) furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4 inch (102 mm) connector shall be permitted. 
Masonry Chimney. From Table F 2.3, the equivalent area for a nominal liner size of 8 inches (203 mm) by 12 inches (305 mm) is 63.6 of a square inch (0.041 m2). Using Table 803.1.3(10), Common Vent Capacity, read down the FAN+ NAT column under the Minimum Internal Area of Chimney value of63 to the row for 30 foot (9144 mm) height to find a capacity value of 739 000 Btu/h (217 kW). The combined input rating of the furnace and water heater, 135 000 Btu/h ( 40 kW), is less than the table value so this is an acceptable installation. 
Section 803.2.16 requires the common vent area to not exceed seven times the smallest listed appliance categorized vent area, flue collar area, or draft hood outlet area. Both appliances in this installation have 4 inch (102 mm) diameter outlets. From Table F 2.3, the equivalent area for an inside diameter of 4 inches (1 02 mm) is 12.2 of a square inch (0.008 m2). Seven times 12.2 equals 85.4, which is exceeding 63.6, so this configuration is acceptable. 



2013 CALIFORNIA MECHANICAL CODE 


F 2.4 Example S(c): Common Venting into an Exterior Masonry Chimney. In this case, the water heater and fan-assisted furnace of Example 5(a) and Example 5(b) are to be common-vented into an exterior masonry chimney. The chimney height, clay-tile-liner dimensions, and vent connector heights and laterals are the same as in Example 5(b). This system is being installed in Charlotte, North Carolina. Does this exterior masonry chimney need to be relined? Where so, what corrugated metallic liner size is recommended? What vent connector diameters are recom­mended? 
Solution: Acording to Section 803.2.19, Type B vent connectors are required to be used with exterior masonry chimneys. Use Table 803.1.3(14) and Table 803.1.3(15) to size FAN+NAT 
common venting installations involving Type-B double-wall connectors into exterior masonry chimneys. 
The local 99 percent winter design temperature needed to use Table 803.1.3(14) and Table 803.1.3(15) shall be found in the ASHRAE Handbook -Fundamentals. For Charlotte, North Carolina, this design temperature is 19°F (-7.2°C). 
Chimney Liner Requirement. As in Example 5(b ), use the 63 square inch (0.04 m2) column ofTable 803.1.3(14) to the 30 foot (9144 mm) height row to find that the combined appliance maximum input is 747 000 Btu/h (218.9 kW). The combined input rating of the appliance in this installation, 135 000 Btu/h ( 40 kW), is less than the maximum value, so this criterion is satisfied. Table 803.1.3(15), at a 19°F (-7.2°C) design temper­ature, and at the same vent height and internal area used earlier, shows that the minimum allowable input rating of a space-heating appliance is 470 000 Btulh (137.7 kW). The furnace

input rating of 100 000 Btu/h (29 kW) is less than this Example Installation: A fan-assisted furnace and a draft hood­minimum value. So this criterion is not satisfied, and an alter­equipped water heater with the following inputs are located in native venting design shall be used, such as a Type B vent a 15 foot (4572 mm) by 30 foot (9144 mm) basement with shown in Example 5( a) or a listed chimney liner system shown an 8 foot (2438 mm) ceiling.
