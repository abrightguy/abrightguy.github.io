PREFACE 

This document is the 6th of 12 parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building Standards Code. This part is known as the California Energy Code. 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legislature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various state agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building reg­ulations, or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipu­lated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 


0 
A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition( s) and the adopted local building 
standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effec­tive sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing. 
Should you find publication (e.g., typographical) errors or inconsistencies in this code or wish to offer comments toward improving its format, please address your comments to:

(b )The requirements of Sections 120.0 through 130.5 (man­datory measures). 
(c)Either the performance compliance approach (energy budgets) in Section 140.1 or the prescriptive compliance approach in Section 140.2 for the climate zone in which the building will be located. Climate zones are shown in Figure 
100. 1-A. 
NOTE: The Commission periodically updates, publishes and makes available to interested persons and local enforcement agencies precise descriptions of the climate zones, which is available by zip code boundaries depicted in the Reference Joint Appendices along with a list of the communities in each zone. 


SECTION 140.1 PERFORMANCE APPROACH: ENERGY BUDGETS 
A building complies with the performance approach if the energy budget calculated for the proposed design building under Subsection (b) is no greater than the energy budget cal­culated for the standard design building under Subsection (a). 
(a) 
Energy budget for the standard design building. The energy budget for a proposed building is determined by apply­ing the mandatory and prescriptive requirements to the pro­posed design building. The energy budget is the sum of the TDV energy for space-conditioning, indoor lighting, mechani­cal ventilation, service water heating and covered process loads. 

(b) 
Energy budget for the proposed design building. The energy budget for a proposed design building is determined by calculating the TDV energy for the proposed design building. 




u 	The energy budget is the sum of the TDV energy for space-conditioning, indoor lighting, mechanical ventilation and service water heating and covered process loads. 
(c) Calculation of energy budget. The TDV energy for both the standard design building and the proposed design building shall be computed by compliance software certified for this use by the Commission. The processes for compliance software approval by the Commission are documented in the Nonresi­dential ACM Approval Manual.

(b) High-rise residential and hoteVmotel occupancies. A service water-heating system installed in high-rise residential or hotel/motel buildings complies with this section if it meets the requirements of Section 150.1(c)8. 
SECTION 140.6 
PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS 
FOR INDOOR LIGHTING 

A building complies with this section if: 
1. 	
The calculation of actual indoor lighting power density of all proposed building areas combined, calculated under Subsection (a) is no greater than the density cal­culation of allowed indoor lighting power density, spe­cific methodologies calculated under Subsection (c); and 
ii. The calculation of allowed indoor lighting power den­sity, general rules comply with Subsection (b); and 
iii. General 	lighting complies with the automatic daylighting controls in secondary daylit zone require­ments in Subsection (d). 
(a) Calculation of actual indoor lighting power density. The actual indoor lighting power density of all proposed build­ing areas is the total watts of all planned permanent and porta­ble lighting systems in all areas of the proposed building; subject to the applicable adjustments under Subdivisions 1 through 3 of this subsection and the requirements of Subdivi­sion 4 of this subsection. 
Exception to Section 140.6(a). Up to 0.3 watts per square foot of portable lighting for office areas shall not be required to be included in the calculation of actual indoor lighting power density. 
1. 	Two interlocked lighting systems. No more than two lighting systems may be used for an area, and if there are two they must be interlocked. Where there are two interlocked lighting systems, the watts of the lower wattage system may be excluded from the actual indoor lighting power density if: 
A. An installation certificate detailing compliance with Section 140.6(a)l is submitted in accordance with Sections 10-103 and 130.4; and 
B. 	The area or areas served by the interlocking systems is an auditorium, a convention center, a conference room, a multipurpose room or a theater; and 
C. 	The two lighting systems are interlocked with a nonprogrammable double-throw switch to prevent simultaneous operation of both systems. 
For compliance with Part 6 a nonprogrammable double-throw switch is an electrical switch com­monly called a "single pole double throw" or "three-way" switch that is wired as a selector switch allowing one of two loads to be enabled. It can be a line voltage switch or a low voltage switch selecting between two relays. It cannot be overridden or changed in any manner that would permit both loads to operate simultaneously. 





2. 	Reduction of wattage through controls. In calculat­ing actual indoor lighting power density, the installed watts of a luminaire providing general lighting in an area listed in Table 140.6-A may be reduced by the product of (i) the number of watts controlled as described in Table 140.6-A, times (ii) the applicable power adjustment factor (PAF), if all of the following conditions are met: 
A. An installation certificate is 	submitted in accor­dance with Section 130.4(b), and 
B. 	Luminaires and controls meet the applicable requirements of Section 110.9, and Sections 130.0 through 130.5; and 
C. The controlled lighting 	is permanently installed general lighting systems and the controls are perma­nently installed nonresidential-rated lighting con­trols. (Thus, for example, portable lighting, portable lighting controls and residential rated lighting con­trols shall not qualify for PAFs.) 
When used for determining PAFs for general light­ing in offices, furniture mounted luminaires that comply with all of the following conditions shall qualify as permanently installed general lighting systems: 
1. 	The furniture mounted luminaires shall be per­manently installed no later than the time of building permit inspection; and 
ii. 	The furniture mounted luminaires shall be per­manently hardwired; and 
iii. The furniture mounted lighting system shall be designed to provide indirect general lighting; and 


tv. 	Before multiplying the installed watts of the fur­niture mounted luminaire by the applicable PAF, 
0.3 watts per square foot of the area illuminated by the furniture mounted luminaires shall be subtracted from installed watts of the furniture mounted luminaires; and 
v. 	
The lighting control for the furniture mounted luminaire complies with all other applicable requirements in Section 140.6(a)2. 

D. 
At least 50 percent of the light output of the con­trolled luminaire is within the applicable area listed in Table 140.6-A. Luminaires on lighting tracks shall be within the applicable area in order to qualify for a PAF. 

E. 	
Only one PAF from Table 140.6-A may be used for each qualifying luminaire. PAFs shall not be added together unless allowed in Table 140.6-A. 

F. 	
Only lighting wattage directly controlled in accor­dance with Section 140.6( a)2 shall be used to reduce the calculated actual indoor lighting power densities as allowed by Section 140.6(a)2. If only a portion of

BUFF 



the wattage in a luminaire is controlled in accor­dance with Section 140.6(a)2, then only that portion of controlled wattage may be reduced in calculating actual indoor lighting power density.
