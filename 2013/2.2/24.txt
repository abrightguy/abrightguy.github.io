2410.1.1 Design. Design of structural sealant glazing (SSG) shall satisfy the following requirements:
1.
SSG shall be weather tight and serviceable under design story drifts associated with the design earth�quake and no glass fallout shall occur at the drifts determined by ASCE 7, Section 13.5.9.

2.
The sealant utilized in the insulated glass units used in SSG shall be designed in accordance with ASTM C 1249. The insulated glass unit design shall be in accordance withASTM C 1249, Section 6.7.2.

3.
Allowable stress for SSG shall not exceed 20 psi and shall have a minimum factor of safety of 5 as required by ASTM C 1401.

4.
Design methodology shall address seismic move�ment in accordance with ASTM C 1401, Section


30.3.4.
5.
SSG systems shall be supported for self-weight and lateral loading at each floor level of the building.

6.
Unitized SSG framing shall be anchored to 	the building floor.bearing plate by screws or bolts and shall not rely upon gravity or frictional forces for attachment.

7.
Framing shall satisfy the 	out-of-plane deflection requirements of this code.


2410.1.2 Testing and inspection. Testing and inspection of structural sealant glazing (SSG) shall satisfy the follow�ing requirements:
a.
The seismic drift capability of structural sealant glazing shall be determined by tests in accordance with AAMA 501.6, AAMA 501.4 and ASCE 7, Sec�tion 13.5.9.2.

b.
The applicability of the specific AAMA 501.6 and AAMA 501.4 testing shall be subject to approval by the building official.
