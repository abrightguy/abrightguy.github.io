[BCD 1] Foun�dation and soils investigations shall be conducted in con�formance with Health and Safety Code Sections 17953 through 17957 as summarized below.

1803.1.1.1 Preliminary soil report. Each city, county, or city and county shall enact an ordinance which requires a preliminary soil report, prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the state. The report shall be based upon adequate test borings or excavations, of every subdivision, where a tentative and final map is required pursuant to Section 66426 of the Government Code.






The preliminary soil report may be waived if the building department of the city, county, or city and county, or other enforcement agency charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of Section 1803.1.1, shall determine that, due to the knowledge such department has as to the soil qualities of the soil of the subdivision or lot, no preliminary analysis is necessary.
1803.1.1.2 Soil investigation by lot, necessity, prepa�ration, and recommendations. If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, such ordinance shall require a soil investigation of each lot in the subdivi�sion.
The soil investigation shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered in this state. It shall recom�mend corrective action which is likely to prevent struc�tural damage to each dwelling proposed to be constructed on the expansive soil.
1803.1.1.3 Approval, building permit conditions, appeal. The building department of each city, county,
or city and county, or other enforcement agency charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of Section 1803.1.1, shall approve the soil investigation if it determines that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed. As a condition to the build�ing permit, the ordinance shall require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each dwelling. Appeal from such deter�mination shall be to the local appeals board.
1803.1.1.4 Liability. A city, county, city and county, or other enforcement agency charged with the administra�tion and enforcement of the provisions of Section 1803.1.1, is not liable for any injury which arises out of any act or omission of the city, county, city and county, other enforcement agency, or a public employee or any other person under Section 1803.1.1.
1803.1.1.5. Alternate procedures. The governing body of any city, county, or city and county may enact an ordinance prescribing an alternate procedure which is equal to or more restrictive than the procedure speci�fied in Section 1803.1.1.

ity-drop or power-actuated hammers and the ham�mer energy used shall be the maximum consistent with the size, strength and weight of the driven ele�ments. The use of a follower is permitted only with the approval of the building official. The introduc�tion of fresh hammer cushion or pile cushion mate�rial just prior to final penetration is not permitted.

The resulting allowable loads shall not be more than one-half of the ultimate axial load capac�ity of the test element as assessed by one of the pub�lished methods listed in Section 1810A.3.3.1.3 with consideration for the test type, duration and subsoil.

Frictional resistance and bearing resistance shall not be assumed to act simultane�ously unless determined by a geotechnical investiga�tion in accordance with Section 1803A.

3689 including the cyclic loading procedure,

foundation elements. For grouped deep foundation
elements subjected to uplift, the allowable working

uplift load for the group shall be calculated by an
approved method of analysis. Where the deep foun-

II
dation elements in the group are placed at a center�to-center spacing of at least 2.5 times the least hori�zontal dimension of the largest single element, the allowable working uplift load for the group is per�mitted to be calculated as the lesser of:
1.
The proposed individual uplift working load times the number of elements in the group.

2.
Two-thirds of the effective weight of the
group and the soil contained within a block
defined by the perimeter of the group and the
length of the element, plus two-thirds of the
ultimate shear resistance along the soil block.





1810A.3.3.1.7 Load-bearing capacity. Deep foun�dation elements shall develop ultimate load capaci�ties of at least twice the design working loads in the designated load-bearing layers. Analysis shall show that no soil layer underlying the designated load�bearing layers causes the load-bearing capacity safety factor to be less than two.
