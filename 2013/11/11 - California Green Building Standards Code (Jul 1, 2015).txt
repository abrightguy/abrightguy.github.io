This document is the 11th of 12 parts of the official compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of regula­
tions to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building Standards Code. This part is known as 
the California Green Building Standards Code, and it is intended that it shall also be known as the CALGreen Code. 

The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California Legislature. The 
0 
California Legislature delegated authority to various State agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regu­lations to implement the State's statutes. These building regulations or standards have the same force oflaw, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipulated. The California Building Standards Code applies to all occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 
A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geologi­cal or topographical conditions. For the purpose of this code, these conditions include local environmental conditions as established 
by a city, county, or city and county. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effective sooner than the effective date of this . edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing.

EFFECTIVE USE OF THIS CODE 
0 
The format of this code is common to other parts of the California Building Standards Code and contains building standards appli­cable to occupancies which fall under the authority of different state agencies. Occupancies and applications under the authority of a specific state agency are identified in Chapter 1, Sections 103 through 106. Sections of this code which are applicable and adopted by each state agency are identified in the Matrix Adoption Tables located at the beginning of each chapter. The following outline is provided as a guide to establish which provisions are applicable to a specific occupancy. 
1. 
Establish the type of occupancy. 

2. Verify which state agency has authority for the established occupancy by reviewing the authorities list in Sections 103 

through 106. 


3. 
Once the appropriate agency has been identified, find the chapter which covers the established occupancy. 

4. 
The Matrix Adoption Tables at the beginning of Chapters 4 and 5 identify the required green building measures necessary to 
meet the minimum requirements of this code for the established occupancy. 


5. 
Voluntary tier measures are contained in Appendix Chapters A4 and AS . A Checklist containing each green building mea­
sure, both required and voluntary is provided at the end of each appendix chapter. Each measure listed in the application 
checklist has a section number which correlates to a section where more information about the specific measure is available. 


6. 
The Application Checklist identifies which measures are required by this code and allows users to check -off which voluntary 
items have been selected to meet voluntary tier levels if desired or mandated by a city, county, or city and county.

Construction Waste Management (CWM) Plan 
Note: This sample form may be used to assist in documenting compliance with the waste management plan. 
Project Name: 

All Subcontractors shall comply with the project's Construction Waste Management Plan. All Subcontractor foremen shall sign the CWM Plan Acknowledgment Sheet. 

Subcontractors who fail to comply with the Waste Management Plan will be subject to backcharges or withholding of payment, as deemed appro­priate. For instance, Subcontractors who conmminate debris boxes that have been designated for a single material type will be subject to backcharge or withheld payment, as deemed appropriate. 
1. 
The project's overall rate of waste diversion will be ___ %. 

2. 	
This project shall generate the least amount of waste possible by planning and ordering carefully, following all proper storage and handling procedures to reduce broken and damaged materials and reusing materials whenever possible. The majority of the waste that is generated on this jobsite will be diverted from the landfill and recycled for other use. 

3. 	
Spreadsheet 1, enclosed, identifies the waste materials that will be generated on this project, the diversion strategy for each waste type and the anticipated diversion rate. 

4. 	
Waste prevention and recycling activities will be discussed at the beginning of weekly subcontractor meetings. As each new subcontractor comes on-site, the WMP Coordinator will present him/her with a copy of the CWM Plan and provide a tour of the jobsite to identify materials to be salvaged and the procedures for handlingjobsite debris. All Subcontractor foremen will acknowledge in writing that they have read and will abide by the CWM Plan. Subcontractor Acknowledgment Sheet enclosed. The CWM Plan will be posted at the jobsite trailer. 

5. 	
Salvage: Excess materials that cannot be used in the project, norreturned to the vendor, will be offered to site workers, the owner, or donated to charity if feasible. 

6. 	
[HAULING COMPANY] will provide a commingled drop box at the jobsite for most of the construction waste. These commingled drop boxes will be taken to [Sorting Facility Name and Location]. The average diversion rate for commingled waste will be ___ %. As site condi­tions permit, additional drop boxes will be used for particular phases of construction (e.g., concrete and wood waste) to ensure the highest waste diversion rate possible. 

7. 	
In the event that the waste diversion rate achievable via the strategy described in ( 6) above, is projected to be lower than what is required, then a strategy of source-separated waste diversion and/or waste stream reduction will be implemented. Source separated waste refers to jobsite 
waste that is not commingled but is instead allocated to a debris box designated for a single material type, such as clean wood or metal. 


Notes: 
1. 	
Waste stream reduction refers to efforts taken by the builder to reduce the amount of waste generated by the project to below four ( 4) pounds per square foot of building area. 

2. 	
When using waste stream reduction measures, the gross weight of the product is subtracted from a base weight of four ( 4) pounds per square foot of building area. This reduction is considered additional diversion and can be used in the waste reduction percentage cal­culations. 



8. 	
[HAULING COMPANY] will track and calculate the quantity (in tons) of all waste leaving the project and calculate the waste diversion rate for the project. [HAULING COMPANY] will provide Project Manager with an updated monthly report on gross weight hauled and the waste diversion rate being achieved on the project. [HAULING COMPANY's] monthly report wili track separately the gross weights and diver­sion rates for commingled debris and for each source-separated waste stream leaving the project. In the event that [HAULING COMPANY] does not service any or all of the debris boxes on the project, the [HAULING COMPANY] will work with the responsible parties to track the material type and weight (in tons) in such debris boxes in order to determine waste diversion rates for these materials. 

9. 	
In the event that Subcontractors furnish their own debris boxes as part of their scope of work, such Subcontractors shall not be excluded from complying with the CWM Plan and will provide [HAULING COMPANY] weight and waste diversion data for their debris boxes. 

10. 	
In the event that site use constraints (such as limited space) restrict the number of debris boxes that can be used for collection of designated waste the project Superintendent will, as deemed appropriate, allocate specific areas onsite where individual material types are to be consoli­dated. These collection points are not to be conmminated with non-designated waste types. 

11. 	
Debris from jobsite office and meeting rooms will be collected by [DISPOSAL SERVICE COMPANY]. [DISPOSAL SERVICE COM­PANY] will, at a minimum, recycle office paper, plastic, metal and cardboard.

during the planning, design and construction process. 
Division A4.1 -PLANNING AND DESIGN 
PREFACE 
Given that land use and planning are largely regulated locally, cities, counties, and cities and counties should consider reduc­ing greenhouse gas emissions associated with development through local land-use practices in conjunction with enforcing the provisions of this code. Specific land use strategies a city, county, or city and county may wish to consider include but are not limited to the following: 
Site selection. Develop sites for buildings, hardscape, roads or parking areas consistent with the local general plan and regional transportation plan pursuant to SB 375 (Stats 2008, Ch. 728). 
Regional sustainable communities strategy. Site selection and building design and use shall conform the project with the prevailing regional sustainable communities strategy or alter­native planning strategy, whichever meets the greenhouse gas target established by the California Air Resources Board pur­suant to SB 375 (Stats. 2008, Ch. 728), including the general location of uses, residential densities and building intensities. 
Transit priority projects. To qualify as a transit priority pro­ject, the project shall meet three criteria: 
(1) (a) contain at least 50 percent residential use, based on total building square footage and, if the project contains between 26 and 50 percent nonresidential uses, a floor area ratio of not less than 0.75; (b) provide a minimum net den­sity of at least 20 dwelling units per acre; and (c) be within one-half mile of a major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor included in a regional transportation plan as described in Section 21 155 of Stats. 2008, Ch. 728; 




(2) 
be consistent with the prevailing sustainable communi­ties strategy or alternative planning strategy, whichever meets the greenhouse gas target established by the Califor­nia Air Resources Board, including the general location of uses, residential densities and building intensities; and 

(3) 
have all necessary entitlements required by the applica­ble local government.

The total material cost is 45 percent of the total cost of the project. Use Equations A4.4-3A or A4.4-3B to determine total material costs using the simplified method. 

Total material costs = 
Project square footage x square foot 
valuation x 45 percent (Equation A4.4-3A) . 

Total estimated or actual cost of 
project x 45 percent (Equation A4.4-3B) 


TABLE A4.405.3 SQUARE FOOT VALUATION 

TYPE OF STRUCTURE  SQUARE FOOT CONSTRUCTION COSTS  
Residential, one-and two-family  $101 .90  
Residential, multiple family  $92.94  

Note: Minimum square foot construction costs for residential one-and two-family and multiple family dwellings are from the International Code 
0

Council's (ICC) Building Valuation Data (BVD )-February 2011. 
2. 	Detailed method. To obtain the total cost of the project, add the estimated and/or actual costs of materials used for the project, including the struc­ture (steel, concrete, wood or masonry); the enclo­sure (roof, windows, doors and exterior walls); the interior walls, ceilings and finishes (gypsum board, ceiling tiles, etc.). The total estimated and/or actual costs shall not include fees, labor and installation costs, overhead, appliances, equip­ment, furniture or furnishings. 


A4.405.3.1.2 Determination of total recycled content value (RCV). Total RCV may be determined either by dollars or percentage as noted below. 
1. 	Total recycled content value for the project (in 
dollars). This is the sum of the recycled content value of the materials and/or assemblies consid­ered and shall be determined by Equation A4.4-4. The result of this calculation may be directly com­pared to Equations A4.4-l and A4.4-2 to deter­
0
mine compliance with Tier 1 or Tier 2 prerequisites. 
Total Recycled Content Value (dollars) = 
(RCVM +RCV .J (Equation A4.4-4) 
2. 	Total recycled content value for the project (by percentage). This is expressed as a percentage of the total material cost and shall be determined by Equation A4.4-4 and Equation A4.4-5. The result of this calculation may be directly compared for compliance with Tier 1 (10 percent) or Tier 2 (15 percent) prerequisites. 
Total Recycled Content Value (percent) = 
[Toci.J. Recycled Content Value (dollars) + 
0
TotalMaterialCost(dollars)] x 100 
(Equation A4.4-5) 

A4.405.3.1.3 Determination of recycled content value of materials (RCV . The recycled content value of each material (RCV M) is calculated by multiplying the cost of material, as defined by the recycled content. See 
0 

Equations A4.4-6 and A4.4-7. 
RCV M (dollars) = Material cost (dollars) x RCM (percent) 
(Equation A4.4-6) 







0 RCM (percent) = Postconsumer content percentage + (1/2) Preconsumer content percentage 
(Equation A4.4-7) 
Notes: 
0 
1. If the postconsumer and preconsumer recycled content is provided in pounds, Equation A4.4-7 may be used, but the final result (in pounds) must be multiplied by 100 to show RCM as a 

percentage. 

0 
2. If the manufacturer reports total recycled con­tent of a material as one percentage in lieu of separately reporting preconsumer and postcon­sumer values, one-half of the total shall be con­sidered preconsumer recycled material and 
one-half of the total shall be considered post consumer recycled material. 
A4.405.3.1.4 Determination of recycled content value of assemblies -(RCVA). Recycled content value of assemblies is calculated by multiplying the total cost of the assembly by the total recycled content of the assem­bly (RC, and shall be determined by Equation A4.4-8. 

RCV A (dollars) = Assembly cost 
(dollars) x TotalRCA(percent) (Equation A4.4-8) 

If not provided by the manufacturer, Total RCA (per­cent) is the sum (L) of the Proportional Recycled Content (PRCM) of each material in the assembly. RCA shall be determined by Equation A4.4-9. 


(Equation A4.4-9) 
PRCM of each material may be calculated by one of two methods using the following formulas: 

Method 1: Recycled content (postconsumer and preconsumer) of each material provided in per­centages 
PRCM (percent) = Weight of material 
(percent) x RCM (percent) (Equation A4.4-10) 

Weight of material (percent) = [Weight of material (lbs) 
0 
+ Weightofassembly(lbs)] x 100 (Equation A4.4-11) 
RCM (percent) = Postconsumer content 
percentage + (1/2) Preconsumer content percentage 
(See Equation A4.4-7) 

0 
Method 2: Recycled content (postconsumer and preconsumer) provided in pounds 
PRCM (percent) = [RCM (lbs) + Weight of 
material (lbs)] x 100 (Equation A4.4-12) 

RCM (lbs) = Postconsumer content (lbs) + (1/2) Preconsumer content (lbs) (Equation A4.4-13) 

Note: If the manufacturer reports total recycled con­tent of a material as one percentage in lieu of sepa­rately reporting preconsumer and postconsumer values, one-half of the total shall be considered pre­consumer recycled material and one-half of the total shall be considered postconsumer recycled material. 

RESIDENTIAL VOLUNTARY MEASURES 
A4.405.3.1.5 Alternate method for concrete. When Supple­mentaty Cementitious Materials (SCMs), such as fly ash or ground blast furnace slag cement, are used in concrete, an alternate method of calculating and reporting recycled content inconcreteproducts shall be pennitted. When determining the recycled content value, the percent recycled content shall be multiplied by the cost of the cementitious materials only, not the total cost of the concrete. 
A4.405.4 Use of building materials from rapidly renewable sources. One or more of the following materials manufactured from rapidly renewable sources or agricultural by-products is used: 
1.

Required Toi:al RCV (dollars) = 
Total Material Cost (dollars) x 15 percent (Equation AS. 4-2) 

For the purposes of this section, materials used as compo­nents of the structural frame shall not be used to calculate recycled content. The structural frame includes the load bearing structural elements such as wall studs, plates, sills, columns, beams, girders, joists, rafters and trusses. 
Notes: 
1. 
Sample forms which allow user input and auto­matic calculation are located at www.hcd.ca.gov/ CALGreen.html and may be used to simplify doc­umenting compliance with this section and for cal­culating recycled content value of materials or assembly products. 

2. 	
Sources and recycled content of some recycled materials can be obtained from CalRecycle if not provided by the manufacturer. 


AS.40S.4.1 Total material cost. Total material cost is the total estimated or actual cost of materials and assembly products used in the project. J'he required total recycled content value for the project (in dollars) shall be determined by Equation A5.4-1 or A5.4-2. 
Total material cost shall be calculated by using one of the methods specified below: 
1. 	Simplified method. To obtain the total cost of the project multiply the square footage of the structure by the square foot valuation established by the enforcing agency. The total material cost is 45 percent of the total cost of the project. Use Equations A5.4-3A or A5.4-3B to determine total material costs using the simplified method. 
Total material costs = 
Project square footage x square foot 
valuation x 45 percent (Equation AS.4-3A) 

Total estimated or actual cost of 
project x 45 percent (Equation AS.4-3B) 

2. 	Detailed method. To obtain the total cost of the pro­ject, add the estimated and/or actual costs of materials used for the project including the structure (steel, concrete, wood or masonry); the enclosure (roof, win­
0
dows, doors and exterior walls); the interior walls, ceilings and finishes (gypsum board, ceiling tiles, etc.). The total estimated and/or actual costs shall not include fees, labor and installation costs, overhead, appliances, equipment, furniture or furnishings. 


AS.40S.4.2 Determination of total recycled content value 
0

(RCV). Total RCV may be determined either by dollars or percentage as noted below. 
1. 	Total recycled content value for the project (in 
dollars). This is the sum of the recycled content value 
of the materials and/or assemblies considered and 
shall be determined by Equation A5 .4-4. The result of 

0
this calculation may be directly compared to Equa­tions A5 .4-1 and A5.4-2 to determine compliance with Tier 1 or Tier 2 prerequisites. 
Total Recycled Content Value (dollars) = 
(RCV M + RCV A) (Equation AS.4-4) 


2. 	Total recycled content value for the project (by per­
centage). This is expressed as a percentage of the total 
material cost and shall be determined by Equations 
A5.4-4 and A5.4-5. The result of this calculation may 

be directly compared for compliance with Tier 1 
(10 percent) or Tier 2 (15 percent) prerequisites. 


Total Recycled Content Value (percent) = 
0
[Total Recycled Content Value (dollars) + Total Mate­rial Cost (dollars)] x 100 (Equation AS. 4-S) 

AS.40S.4.3 Determination of recycled content value of materials (RCV . The recycled content value of each material (RCV  is calculated by multiplying the cost of material, as defined by the recycled content. See Equations A5.4-6 and A5.4-7. 
RCVM (dollars) = 
Material cost (dollars) x RCM (percent) (Equation AS. 4-6) 

RCM (percent) = Postconsumer content percentage + {1/2) Preconsumer content percentage (Equation AS. 4-7) 

Notes:

AS.40S.4.4 Determination of recycled content value of assemblies -(RCVA). Recycled content value of assem­
0

blies is calculated by multiplying the total cost of assembly by the total recycled content of the assembly (RCA), and shall be determined by Equation A5.4-8. 
2013 CALIFORNIA GREEN BUILDING STANDARDS CODE 
0 RCV A (dollars) = Assembly cost (dollars) x 
Total RCA (percent) (Equation A5.4.8) 

If not provided by the manufacturer, Total RCA (percent) is the sum (l:) of the Proportional Recycled Content (PRCM) of each material in the assembly. RCA shall be determined by Equation A4.4-9. 


(Equation A5.4-9) 

PRCM of each material may be calculated by one of two methods using the following formulas: 
0 
Method 1: Recycled content (Postconsumer and Preconsumer) of each material provided in percentages 
PRCM (percent) = Weight of material (percent) x RCM (percent) (Equation A5.4-10) 
Weight of material (percent) = 
[Weight of material Obs) + Weight of 
assembly Obs)] x 100 (Equation A5.4-11) 

RCM (percent) = Postconsumer content 
percentage + (1/2) Preconsumer content 
percentage (See Equation A5.4-7) 


Method 2: Recycled content (Postconsumer and Preconsumer) provided in pounds 

PRCM (percent) = [RCM Obs) Weight of 
material Obs)] x 100 (Equation A5.4-12) 
RCM Obs) = Postconsumer content Obs) + 
(1/2) Preconsumer content (lbs) (Equation A5.4-13) 
Note: If the manufacturer does not separately identify the preconsumer and postconsumer recy­cled content of a material but reports it as a total single percentage, one half of the total shall be con­sidered preconsumer and one half shall be consid­ered postconsumer recycled material.

A5.405.4.5 Alternate method for concrete. When Supple­
mentary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), such as fly ash or 
ground blast furnace slag cement, are used in concrete, an 
alternate method of calculating and reporting recycled con­
tent in concrete products shall be permitted. When deter­


mining the recycled content value, the percent recycled content shall be multiplied by the cost of the cementitious materials only, not the total cost of the concrete.

NONRESIDENTIAL VOLUNTARY MEASURES 





Division A5.5 -ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 

SECTION A5.501 
GENERAL 

A5.501.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall outline means of reducing the quantity of air contaminants that are odorous, irritating and/or harmful to the comfort and well-being of a building's installers, occupants and neighbors. 
SECTION A5.502 
DEFINITIONS 

A5.502.1 Definitions. The following terms are defined in Chapter 2. 
INTERIOR, BUILDING. 
MERV. [BSC] 
MULTI-OCCUPANT SPACES. 

NO ADDED FORMALDEHYDE (NAF) BASED RESINS. 
SINGLE OCCUPANT SPACES. 
ULTRA-LOW EMITTING FORMALDEHYDE (ULEF) RESINS. 
SECTION A5.504 
POLLUTANT CONTROL 

A5.504.1 Indoor air quality (IAQ) during construction. 
Maintain IAQ as provided in Sections A5.504.1.1 and A5.504. 1.2. 
A5.504.1.1 Temporary ventilation. Provide temporary ventilation during construction in accordance with Section 121 (Requirements for Ventilation) of the California Energy Code, CCR, Title 24, Part 6 and Chapter 4 of CCR, Title 8 and as follows: 
1. 	
Ventilation during construction shall be achieved through openings in the building shell using fans to produce a minimum of three air changes per hour. 

2. 	
If the building is occupied during demolition or con­struction, meet or exceed the recommended Control Measures of the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning National Contractors Association (SMACNA) IAQ Guidelines for Occupied Buildings under Construc­tion, 1995, Chapter 3. 

3. 
The permanent HV AC system shall only be used dur­ing construction if necessary to condition the building within the required temperature range for material and equipment installation. If the HV AC system is used during construction, use return air filters with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 8, based on ASHRAE 52.2-1999, or an average effi­ciency of 30 percent based on ASHRAE 52.1-1992. Replace all filters immediately prior to occupancy. 




4. During dust-producing operations, 	protect supply and return HVAC system openings from dust. 
A5.504.1.2 Additional IAQ measures. Employ additional measures as follows: 
1. 
When using generators to generate temporary power, use generators meeting the requirements of CCR, Title 13, Chapter 9 or local ordinance, whichever is more stringent. 

2. 
Protect on-site 	absorbent materials from moisture. Remove and replace any materials with evidence of mold, mildew or moisture infiltration. 

3. 
Store odorous 	and high VOC-emitting materials off-site, without packaging, for a sufficient period to allow odors and VOCs to disperse. 

4. 
When possible, 	once materials are on the jobsite, install odorous and high VOC-ernitting materials prior to those that are porous or fibrous. 

5. 	
Clean oil and dust from ducts prior to use. 



A5.504.2 IAQ postconstruction. After all interior finishes have been installed, flush out the building by supplying contin­uous ventilation with all air handling units at their maximum outdoor air rate and all supply fans at their maximum position and rate for at least 14 days. 
1. 	
During this time, maintain an internal temperature of at least 60°F and relative humidity no higher than 60 per­cent. If extenuating circumstances make these tempera­ture and humidity limits unachievable, the flush-out may be conducted under conditions as close as possible to these limits, provided that documentation of the extenu­ating circumstances is provided in writing. 

2. 	
Occupancy may start after 4 days, provided flush-out continues for the full 14 days. During occupied times, the thermal comfort conditions of Title 24 must be met. 

3. 	
For buildings that rely on natural ventilation, exhaust fans and floor fans must be used to improve air mixing and removal during the 14-day flush-out and windows should remain open. 

4. 
Do not "bake out" the building by increasing the temper­ature of the space. 

5. 	
If continuous ventilation is not possible, flush-out air must total the equivalent of 14 days of maximum outdoor air. The equivalent of 14 days of maximum outdoor air (the target air volume) shall be calculated by multiplying the maximum feasible air flow rate (in ft3/m) by 14 days (20, 160 minutes). The air volumes for each period of ven­tilation are then calculated and summed and the flush-out continues until the total equals the target air volume. 


A5.504.2.1 IAQ testing. If the engineer determines that building flush-out pursuant to Section A5.504.2 is not feasi­ble, a testing alternative may be employed after all interior finishes have been installed, using testing protocols recog­nized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). 




A5.504.2.1.1 Maximum levels of contaminants. 
Allowable levels of contaminant concentrations mea­sured by testing shall not exceed the following: 
1. 
Carbon Monoxide (CO): 9 parts per million, not to exceed outdoor levels by 2 parts per million; 

2. 
Formaldehyde: 27 parts per billion; 

3. 
Particulates (PM1 0): 50 micrograms per cubic meter; 

4. 
4-Phenylcyclohexene ( 4-PCH), if fabrics and car­pets with styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex backing, are installed: 6.5 micrograms per cubic meter; and 

5. 
Totill Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC): 300 micrograms per cubic meter. 


A5.504.2.1.2 Test protocols. Testing of indoor air qual­ity should include the following elements: 
1. 
The contaminant sampling and averaging times and the measurement methods should be sufficient to achieve a Limit of Detection that is below the maximum allowable concentrations. 

2. 
Testing should be conducted with the HVAC sys­tem operated at the minimum design outdoor air ventilation rate. 

3. 
Air samplers and monitors should be located near likely sources of formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds, at a height of 3 to 6 feet from the floor and well away from walls and air diffusers. 

4. 
The test protocols should be justified with docu­mentation to show that appropriate sampling methods and times were used. 



A5.504.2.1.3 Noncomplying building areas. For each sampling area of the building exceeding the maximum concentrations specified in Section A5.504.2.1.1, flush out with outside air and retest samples taken from the same area. Repeat the procedures until testing demon­strates compliance. 
Note: U.S. EPA-recognized testing protocols may be found on the Air Resources Board web site. 
A5.504.4.5.1 No added formaldehyde Tier 1. Use composite wood products approved by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) as no-added formaldehyde (NAF) based resins or ultra-low emitting formaldehyde (ULEF) resins.
