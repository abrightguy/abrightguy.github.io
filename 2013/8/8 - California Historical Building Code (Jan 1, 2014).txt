PREFACE 



This document is the 8th of 12 parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legis­
0 	lature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various state 
agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building regulations, or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless oth­erwise stipulated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 






A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard( s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effec­
tive sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing.

201 3 CALIFORNIA HISTORICAL BUILDING CODE 




PART 8 CONTAINS ALTERNATIVE REGULATIONS FOR 
QUALIFIED HISTORICAL BUILDINGS 




The California Historical Building Code (CHBC) is unique among state regulations. The authoring of the original CHBC required state agencies promulgating regulations for building construction to work in harmony with representatives of other design and construction disciplines. The result was a totally new approach to building codes for historical structures, which maintains currently acceptable life-safety standards. 
These regulations are also unique in that they are performance oriented rather than prescriptive. The provisions of the CHBC are to be applied by the enforcing authority of every city, county, city and county,.or state agency in permitting repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, reha­bilitation, relocation, related construction, change of use or continued use of a qualified historical building. 
The authority for use of the CHBC is vested in Sections 18950 through 18961 of the Health and Safety Code. Section 18954 states, "The building department of every city or county shall apply the provisions of alternative building standards and building regulations adopted by the CHBC Board pursuant to Section 18959.5 in permitting repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, moving or continued use of an historical building or structure. A state agency shall apply the alternative building regulations adopted by the CHBC Board pursuant to Section 18959.5 in permitting repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, moving or continued use of an historical building or structure." 
However, be aware that in order to use the CHBC, the structure under consideration must be qualified by being designated as an historical building or structure. Section 18955 states, "For the purposes of this part, a qualified historical building or struc­ture is any structure or collection of structures, and their associ­ated sites deemed of importance to the history, architecture or culture of an area by an appropriate local or state governmental jurisdiction. This shall include structures on existing or future national, state or local historical registers or official invento­ries, such as the National Register of Historic Places, State His­torical Landmarks, State Points of Historical Interest, and city or county registers or inventories of historical or architecturally significant sites, places, historic districts or landmarks." 


The regulations of the CHBC have the same authority as state law and are to be considered as such. Liability is the same as for prevailing law. 
The intent of the CHBC is to save California's architectural heritage by recognizing the unique construction problems inherent in historical buildings and by providing a code to deal with these problems.

2013 CALIFORNIA HISTORICAL BUILDING CODE 




HISTORICAL PREFACE 




The background of the California Historical Building Code can be traced to December 1973, when the State Departtnent of Parks and Recreation published the California History Plan, Volume I, in which Recommendation No. 11 was proposed by the then California Landmarks Advisory Committee (later to 0 become The State Historical Resources Commission). This proposal expressed a need for a new building code to meet the intent of protecting the public health and safety and also retain "enough flexibility to allow restoration of a Historic feature while still retaining its Historic integrity." No. 11 of this His­tory Plan supported this need by stating that" ... restoration ... 
() 	is frequently made difficult by unnecessarily rigid interpreta­tion of building ... codes." 
In March of 1974, the Landmarks Committee by resolution recommended that the Director of the State Departtnent of Parks and Recreation and the State Architect initiate a study to develop this needed code. These two officials accepted this concept and jointly called a statewide meeting in Sacramento on May 14th of that year. Attending were representatives from both the public and private sectors, such as members of the building industry, design professions, local and state building officials, and others interested in this problem. 
Out of this open conference, a steering committee was formed to explore in depth the ways and means of implementing the new historical building code concept. This ad hoc committee was chaired by a representative from the California Council, American Institute of Architects and composed of a compre­hensive cross section of the professional organizations and government agencies concerned with design and code enforcement. 

Meetings began late in 1974 and continued into early 1975. By April of that year, a legislative subcommittee of the ad hoc group drafted a sample bill for the proposed code and requested that it be carried by Senator James R. Mills, President Pro Tern­
() 
pore of the Senate. After further development and refinement, the enacting legislation to create the authority for the code and an advisory board to prepare regulations to implement it (SB 927, Mills) was supported by both the legislature and the pub­lic. It was signed by the governor in September 1975, and became effective January 1, 1976. 
The members of the advisory board, which were required by law to include local and state building officials, individuals from the building industry and design professions, as well as representatives from city and county governments, were appointed and held their first session in Sacramento, February 24, 1976. This Board's duties included the preparation of code regulations and the review of specific historic building cases, when officially requested by governing bodies. 
Several of the Board's members were a part of the original ad hoc steering committee and thus provided a continuity and smooth transition from the inception of the code's philosophy to its pragmatic implementation in these performance-oriented regulations. 
The first comprehensive regulations were codified in August and October 1979, after years of careful deliberation. Those regulations allowed all jurisdictions to utilize them at their dis­cretion in replacing or modifying details of prevailing prescrip­tive codes. 
Changes made in law in 1984 and 1991, and to the code, make the application of the California Historical Building Code stat­utes and regulations applicable for all agencies and at the dis­cretion of the owner for local jurisdictions when dealing with qualified historical buildings. 
These current performance regulations were adopted by the Board on June 23, 1998, and approved by the California Build­ing Standards Commission on December 12, 2013.

CHAPTER 8·1 
0 

ADMINIS TRATION 
Note: The California Historical Building Code, Part 8 of Title 24, governs for all qualified historical buildings or properties in the State of California. 
0 
SECTION 8-101 TITLE, PURPOSE AND INTENT 
0 
8-101.1 Title. These regulations shall be known as the Califor­nia Historical Building Code and will be referred to herein as "the CHBC." 
8-101.2 Pt!rpose. The purpose of the CHBC is to provide regu­lations for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, reloca­tion or reconstruction of buildings or properties designated as qualified historical buildings or properties (Chapter 8-2). The CHBC is intended to provide solutions for the preservation of qualified historical buildings or properties, to promote sustainability, to provide access for persons with disabilities, to provide a cost-effective approach to preservation, and to pro­vide for the reasonable safety of the occupants or users. The 
CHBC requires enforcing agencies to accept solutions that are reasonably equivalent to the regular code (as defined in Chap­ter 8-2) when dealing with qualified historical buildings or properties. 

8-101.3 Intent. The intent of the CHBC is to facilitate the pres­ervation and continuing use of qualified historical buildings or properties while providing reasonable safety for the building occupants and access for persons with disabilities. 
SECTION 8-102 APPLICATION 
8-102.1 Application. The CHBC is applicable to all issues regarding code compliance for qualified historical buildings or properties. The CHBC may be used in conjunction with the regular code to provide solutions to facilitate the preservation of qualified historical buildings or properties. The CHBC shall be used by any agency with jurisdiction and whenever compli­ance with the code is required for qualified historical buildings 
0 or properties. 
1. 
The state or local enforcing agency shall apply the pro­visions of the CHBC in penirltting repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restora­tion, reconstruction, rehabilitation, relocation or con­tinued use of a qualified historical building or property when so elected by the private property owner. 

2. 	
State agencies. All state agencies shall apply the provi­sions of the CHBC in permitting repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, safety, relocation, reconstruction or con­tinued use of qualified historical buildings or proper­ties. 




8-102.1.1 Additions, alterations and repairs. It is the intent of the CHBC to allow nonhistorical expansion or addition to a qualified historical building or property, pro­
201 3 CALIFORNIA HISTORICAL BUILDING CODE 




vided nonhistorical additions shall conform to the requirements of the regular code. See Chapter 8-2. 
8-102.1.2 Relocation. Relocated qualified historical build­ings or properties shall be sited to comply with the regular code or with the solutions listed in the CHBC. Nonhistorical new construction related to relocation shall comply with the regular code. Reconstruction and restoration related to relo­cation is permitted to comply with the provisions in the 
CHBC. 

8-102.1.3 Change 
of occupancy. For change of use or occupancy, see Chapter 8-3, Use and Occupancy. 
8-102.1.4 Continued use. Qualified historical buildings or properties may have their existing use or occupancy contin­ued if such use or occupancy conformed to the code or to the standards of construction in effect at the time of construc­tion, and such use or occupancty does not constitute a dis­tinct hazard to life safety as defined in the CHBC. 
8-102.1.5 Unsafe buildings or properties. When a quali­fied historical building or property is determined to be unsafe as defined in the regular code, the requirements of the CHBC are applicable to the work necessary to correct the unsafe conditions. Work to remediate the buildings or properties need only address the correction of the unsafe conditions, and it shall not be required to bring the entire qualified historical building or property into compliance with regular code. 
8-102.1.6 Additional work. Qualified historical buildings or properties shall not be subject to additional work required by the regular code, regulation or ordinance beyond that required to complete the work undertaken. Certain excep­tions for accessibility and for distinct hazards exist by man­date and may require specific action, within the parameters of theCHBC. 
SECTION 8-103 
ORGANIZATION AND ENFORCEMENT 



8-103.1 Authority. The state or local enforcing agency, pursu­ant to authority provided Under Section 18954 of the Health and Safety Code, shall administer and enforce the provisions of the CHBC in permitting repairs, alterations and additions nec­essary for the preservation, restoration, reconstruction, reha­bilitation, relocation or continued use of a qualified historical building or property. 
8-103.2 State enforcement. All state agencies pursuant to authority provided under Section 18954 and Section 18961 of the Health and Safety Code shall administer and enforce the 
CHBC with respect to qualified historical buildings or proper­ties under their respective jurisdiction. 






ADMINISTRATION 
8-103.3 Liability. Prevailing law regarding immunity of build­ing officials is unaffected by the use and enforcement of the CHBC. 
SECTION 8-104 
REVIEW AND APPEALS 

8-104.1 State Historical Building Safety Board (SHBSB). In 
order to provide for interpretation of the provisions of the CHBC and to hear appeals, the SHBSB shall act as an appeal and review body to state and local agencies or any affected party. 
8-104.2 SHBSB review. When a proposed design, material or method of construction is being considered by the enforcing agency, the agency chief, the building official or the local board of appeals may file a written request for opinion to the SHBSB for its consideration,· advice or findings. In considering such request, the SHBSB may seek the advice of other appropriate private or public boards, individuals, or state or local agencies. The SHBSB shall, after considering all of the facts presented, including any recommendation of other appropriate boards, agencies or other parties, determine ·if, for the purpose intended, the proposal is reasonably equivalent to that allowed by these regulations in proposed design, material or method of construction, and it shall transmit such findings and its decision to the enforcing agency for its application. The Board may recover the costs of such reviews and shall report the decision in printed form, copied to the California Building Standards Commission. 
8-104.2.1 State agencies. All state agencies with ownership of, or that act on behalf of state agency owners of, qualified historical buildings or properties, shall consult and obtain SHBSB review prior to taking action or making decisions or appeals that affect qualified historical buildings or proper­ties, per Section 18961 of the Health and Safety Code. 

8-104.2.2 Imminent threat. Where an emergency is declared and a qualified historical building or property is declared an imminent threat to life and safety, the state agency assessing such a threat shall consult with the SHBSB before any demolition is undertaken, per Section 18961 of the Health and Safety Code. 
8-104.3 SHBC appeals. If any local agency administering and enforcing the CHBC or any person adversely affected by any regulation, rule, omission, interpretation, decision or practice of the agency enforcing the CHBC wishes to appeal the issue for resolution to the SHBSB, either of these parties may appeal directly to the Board. The Board may accept the appeal only if it determines that issues involved are of statewide significance. The Board may recover the costs of such reviews and shall make available copies of decisions in printed form at cost, cop­ied to the California Building Standards Commission. 
8-104.4 Local agency fees. Local agencies, when actively involved in the appeal, may also charge affected persons rea­sonable fees not to exceed the cost of obtaining reviews and appeals from the Board. 

SECTION 8-105 
CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS 


8-105.1 Repairs. Repairs to any portion of a qualified histori­cal building or property may be made in-kind with historical materials and the use of original or existing historical methods of construction, subject to conditions of the CHBC. (See Chap­ter 8-8.) 


8-105.2 Solutions to the California Historical Building 
()

Code. Solutions provided in the CHBC, or any other acceptable regulation or methodology of design or construction and used in whole or in part, with the regular code, or with any combina­
tion of the regular code and the CHBC, shall be allowed. ·The CHBC does not preclude the use of any proposed alternative or method of design or construction not specifically prescribed or otherwise allowed by these regulations. Any alternative may be submitted for evaluation to the appropriate enforcing agency for review and acceptance. The enforcing agency may request that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claims that may be made regarding such solutions. Any alternative offered in lieu of that prescribed or allowed in the CHBC shall be reasonably equivalent in quality, strength, effectiveness, durability and safety to that of the CHBC. 

SECTION 8-106 SHBSB RULINGS 

8-106.1 General. Rulings of the SHBSB (i.e., formal appeals, 
case decisions, code interpretations and administrative resolu­
tions, etc.) that are issues of statewide application are required 0 
to be submitted to the California Building Standards Commis­
sion in printed form. These rulings may be used to provide 
guidance for similar cases or issues.

CHAPTER 8·2 

DEFINITIONS 
SECTION 8-201 0 DEFINITIONS 
For the purpose of the CHBC, certain terms and phrases, words and their derivatives shall be construed as specified in this chapter. Additional definitions and/or terms may appear in the various other chapters relative to terms or phrases primarily applicable thereto. Any reference to "authority having jurisdic­0 tion" does not necessarily preclude the appellate process of Section 8-104.3. 
ADDITION. A nonhistorical extension or increase in floor area or height of a building or property. 
ALTERATION. A modification to a qualified historical build­ing or property that affects the usability of the building or property, or part thereof. Alterations include, but are not lim­ited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historical restoration, changes or rearrangement of the struc­tural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangements in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. 

BUILDING STANDARD. Any guideline, regulation or code that may be applied to a qualified historical building or property. 
CHARACTER-DEFINING FEATURE. Those visual aspects and physical elements that comprise the appearance of a historical building or property, and that are significant to its historical, architectural and cultural values, including the over­all shape of the historical building or property, its materials, craftsmanship, decorative details, interior spaces and features, as well as the various aspects of its site and environment. 
CULTURAL RESOURCE. Building, site, property, object or district evaluated as having significance in prehistory or history. 
DISTINCT HAZARD. Any clear and evident condition that exists as an immediate danger to the safety of the occupants or public right of way. Conditions that do not meet the require­ments of current regular codes and ordinances do not, of them­selves, constitute a distinct hazard. Section 8-104.3, SHBC appeals, remains applicable. 

ENFORCING AGENCY, Authority Having Jurisdiction, Local Agency with Jurisdiction. An entity with the responsibil­ity for regulating, enforcing, reviewing or otherwise that exerts control of or administration over the process of gaining per­mits, approvals, decisions, variances, appeals for qualified his­torical buildings or properties. 

EXIT LADDER DEVICE. An exit ladder device is a perma­nently installed, fixed, folding, retractable or hinged ladder intended for use as a means of emergency egress from areas of the second or third stories. Unless approved specifically for a longer length, the ladder shall be limited to 25 feet (7620 mm) in length. Exit ladders are permitted where the area served by the ladder has an occupant load less than 10 persons. 

201 3 CALIFORNIA HISTORICAL BUILDING CODE 


-

FIRE HAZARD. Any condition which increases or may con­tribute to an increase in the hazard or menace of fire to a greater degree than customarily recognized by the authority having jurisdiction, or any condition or act which could obstruct, delay, hinder or interfere with the operations of firefighting personnel or the egress of occupants in the event of fire. Section 8-104.3, SHBC appeals, remains applicable. 
HISTORICAL FABRIC OR MATERIALS. Original and later-added historically significant construction materials, architectural finishes or elements in a particular pattern or con­figuration which form a qualified historical property, as deter­mined by the authority having jurisdiction. 
HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. Importance for which a property has been evaluated and found to be historical, as deter­mined by the authority having jurisdiction. 
IMMINENT THREAT. Any condition within or affecting a qualified historical building or property which, in the opinion of the authority having jurisdiction, would qualify a building or property as dangerous to the extent that the life, health, prop­erty or safety of the public, its occupants or those performing necessary repair, stabilization or shoring work are in immedi­ate peril due to conditions affecting the building or property. Potential hazards to persons using, or improvements within, the right -of -way may not be construed to be "imminent threats" solely for that reason if the hazard can be mitigated by shoring, stabilization, barricades or temporary fences. 
INTEGRITY. Authenticity of a building or property's his­torical identity, evidenced by the survival of physical charac­teristics that existed during the property's historical or prehistorical period of significance. 
LIFE-SAFETY EVALUATION. An evaluation of the life-safety hazards of a qualified historical building or property based on procedures similar to those contained in NFPA 909, 
Standard for the Protection of Cultural Resources, Appendix B, Fire Risk Assessment in Heritage Premises. 
LIFE SAFETY HAZARD. See Distinct Hazard. 
PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANCE. The period of time when a qualified historical building or property was associated with important events, activities or persons, or attained the charac­teristics for its listing or registration. 
PRESERVATION. The act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form, integrity and materials of a qualified historical building or property. Work, including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the property, gen­erally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and repair of his­toric materials and features rather than extensive replacement and new construction. New exterior additions are not within the scope of this treatment; however, the limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and other code-related work to make properties functional is appro­priate within a preservation project.

NONHISTORICAL ALTERATIONS 


8-704.1 New nonhistorical additions and nonhistorical alter­ations which are structurally separated from an existing histori­cal building or structure shall comply with regular code requirements. 
8-704.2 New nonhistorical additions which impose vertical or lateral loads on an existing structure shall not be permitted unless the affected part of the supporting structure is evaluated and strengthened, if necessary, to meet regular code require­ments. 
Note: For use of archaic materials, see Chapter 8-8. 
SECTION 8-705 
STRUCTURAL REGULATIONS 


8-705.1 Gravity loads. The capacity of the structure to resist gravity loads shall be evaluated and the structure strengthened as necessary. The evaluation shall include all parts of the load path. Where no distress is evident, and a complete load path is present, the structure may be assumed adequate by having withstood the test of time if anticipated dead and live loads will not exceed those historically present. 
8-705.2 Wind and seismic loads. The ability of the structure to resist wind and seismic loads shall be evaluated. Wind loads shall be considered when appropriate, but need not exceed 75% of the wind loads prescribed by the regular code. The evalua­tion shall be based on the requirements of Section 8-706. 
8.705.2.1 Any unsafe conditions in the lateral-load-resisting system shall be corrected, or alternative resistance shall be pro­vided. When strengthening is required, additional resistance shall be provided to meet the minimum requirements of the CHBC. The strengthening measures shall be selected with the intent of meeting the performance objectives set forth in Sectio 8-701.2. The evaluation of structural members and structural systems for seismic loads shall consider the inelastic perfor­mance of structural members and their ability to maintain load-carrying capacity during the seismic loadings prescribed by the regular code. 
8.705.2.2 The architect or engineer shall consider additional measures with minimal loss of, and impact to, historical mate­rials which will reduce damage and needed repairs in future earthquakes to better preserve the historical structure in perpetuity. These additional measures shall be presented to the owner for consideration as part of the rehabilitation or restoration. 

STRUCTURAL REGULATIONS 

SECTION 8-706 
LATERAL LOAD REGULATIONS 

8-706.1 Seismic forces. Strength-level seismic forces used to evaluate the structure for resistance to seismic loads shall be based on the R-values tabulated in the regular code for similar lateral-force-resisting systems including consideration of the structural detailing of the members where such R-values exist. Where such R-values do not exist, an appropriate R-value shall be rationally assigned considering the structural detailing of the members. 
Exceptions: 
1. 
The forces need not exceed 0.75 times the seismic forces prescribed by the regular code requirements. 

2. 
For Occupancy Category I, II 	or III structures, near-fault increases in ground motion (maximum considered earthquake ground motion of 0.2 second spectral response greater than 150 percent at 5 percent damping) need not be considered when the funda­mental period of the building is 0.5 seconds in the direction under consideration. 

3. 
For Occupancy Category I or II structures, the seismic base shear need not exceed 0.30W. 

4. 
For Occupancy Category ill or IV structures, the seis­mic base shear need not exceed 0.40W. 


8-706.1.1 When a building is to be strengthened with the addition of a new lateral force resisting system, the R value of the new system can be used when the new lateral force resisting system resists at least 75 percent of the building's base shear regardless of its relative rigidity. 
8-706.1.2 Unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings shall comply with the California Existing Building Code (CEBC), Appendix Chapter A1, 2010 Edition, and as modi­fied by the CHBC. Alternative standards may be used on a case-by-case basis when approved by the authority having jurisdiction. It shall be permitted to exceed the strength limi­tation of 100 psi in Section A108.2 of the CEBC when test data and building configuration supports higher values sub­ject to the approval of the authority having jurisdiction. 
8-706.1.3 All deviations from the detailing provisions of the lateral-force-resisting systems shall be evaluated for stabil­ity and the ability to maintain load-carrying capacity at the expected inelastic deformations. 
8-706.2 Existing building performance. The seismic resis­tance may be based upon the ultimate capacity of the structure to perform, giving due consideration to ductility and reserve strength of the lateral-force-resisting system and materials while maintaining a reasonable factor of safety. Broad judgment may be exercised regarding the strength and perfor­mance of materials not recognized by regular code require­ments. (See Chapter 8-8, Archaic Materials and Methods of Construction.) 
8-706.2.1All structural materials or members that do not 
comply with detailing and proportioning requirements of 
the regular code shall be evaluated for potential seismic per­
formance and the consequence of non-compliance. All 
members that would be reasonably expected to fail and lead 
to collapse or life threatening injury when subjected to seis­
mic demands shall be judged unacceptable, and appropriate 
structural strengthening shall be developed. 



8-706.3 Load path. A complete and continuous load path, including connections, from every part or portion of the struc­ture to the ground shall be provided for the required forces. It shall be verified that the structure is adequately tied together to perform as a unit when subjected to earthquake forces. 
8-706.4 Parapets. Parapets and exterior decoration shall be investigated for conformance with regular code requirements for anchorage and ability to resist prescribed seismic forces. 


An exception to regular code requirements shall be permit­ted for those parapets and decorations which are judged not to be a hazard to life safety. 
8-706.5 Nonstructural features. Nonstructural features of historical structure, such as exterior veneer, cornices and deco­rations, which might fall and create a life-safety hazard in an earthquake, shall be evaluated. Their ability to resist seismic forces shall be verified, or the feature shall be strengthened with improved anchorage when appropriate. 
8-706.5.1 Partitions and ceilings of corridors and stairways 
serving an occupant load of 30 or more shall be investigated 
to determine their ability to remain in place when the build­
ing is subjected to earthquake forces.

ARCHAIC MATERIALS AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION 

SECTION 8-801 PURPOSE, INTENT AND SCOPE 
0 	8-801.1 Purpose. The purpose of the CHBC is to provide regu­lations for the use of historical methods and materials of con­struction that are at variance with regular code requirements or are not otherwise codified, in buildings or structures desig­nated as qualified historical buildings or properties. The CHBC require enforcing agencies to accept any reasonably equivalent 
0 	alternatives to the regular code when dealing with qualified his­torical buildings or properties. 
8-801.2 Intent. It is the intent of the CHBC to provide for the use of historical methods and materials of construction that irre at variance with specific code requirements or are not other­wise codified. 
8-801.3 Scope. Any construction type or material that is, or was, part of the historical fabric of a structure is covered by this chapter. Archaic materials and methods of construction present in a historical structure may remain or be reinstalled or be installed with new materials of the same class to match existing conditions. 

SECTION 8-802 GENERAL ENGINEERING APPROACHES 

Strength values for archaic materials shall be assigned based upon similar conventional codified materials, or on tests as hereinafter indicated. The archaic materials and methods of construction shall be thoroughly investigated for their details of construction in accordance with Section 8-703. Testing shall be performed when applicable to evaluate existing conditions. The architect or structural engineer in responsible charge of the project shall assign allowable stresses or strength levels to archaic materials. Such assigned strength values shall not be greater than those provided for in the following sections with­out adequate testing, and shall be subject to the concurrence of the enforcing agency. 

SECTION 8-803 NONSTRUCTURAL ARCHAIC MATERIALS 
Where nonstructural historical materials exist in uses which do not meet the requirements of the regular code, their continued use is allowed by this code, provided that any public health and life-safety hazards are mitigated subject to the concurrence of the enforcing agency. 

SECTION 8-804 ALLOWABLE CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIC MATERIALS 
Archaic materials which exist and are to remain in qualified historical buildings or structures shall be evaluated for their condition and for loads required by this code. The structural survey required in Section 8-703 of the CHBC shall document existing conditions, reinforcement, anchorage, deterioration and other factors pertinent to establishing allowable stresses, strength levels and adequacy of the archaic materials. The remaining portion of this chapter provides additional specific requirements for commonly encountered archaic materials. 






SECTION 8-805 
MASONRY 


For adobe, see Section 8-806. 
8-805.1 Existing solid masonry. Existing solid masonry walls 
of any type, except adobe, may be allowed, without testing, a maximum ultimate strength of nine pounds per square inch 
( 62.1 kPa) in shear where there is a qualifying statement by the 
architect or engineer that an inspection has been made, that mortar joints are filled and that both brick and mortar are rea­sonably good. The shear stress above applies to unreinforced masonry, except adobe, where the maximum ratio of unsup­ported height or length to thickness does not exceed 13, and where minimum quality mortar is used or exists. Wall height or length is measured to supporting or resisting elements that are at least twice as stiff as the tributary wall. Stiffness is based on the gross section. Shear stress may be increased by the addition of 10 percent of the axial direct stress due to the weight of the wall directly above. Higher-quality mortar may provide a greater shear value and shall be tested in accordance with Appendix A, Chapter A1 of the California Existing Building Code (CEBC) 2010 edition, and as modified by the CHBC. 


8-805.2 Stone masonry. 


8-805.2.1 Solid-backed stone masonry. Stone masonry solidly backed with brick masonry shall be treated as solid 
· brick masonry as described in Section 8-805.1 and in the 2009 IEBC, provided representative testing and inspection verifies solid collar joints between stone and brick and that a reasonable number of stones lap with the brick wythes as headers or that steel anchors are present. Solid stone masonry where the wythes of stone effectively overlap to provide the equivalent header courses may also be treated as solid brick masonry. 


8-805.2.2 Independent wythe stone masonry. Stone masonry with independent face wythes may be treated as solid brick masonry as described in Section 8-805.1 and the CEBC, provided representative testing and inspection ver­ify that the core is essentially solid in the masonry wall and that steel ties are epoxied in drilled holes between outer 

stone wythes at floors, roof and not to exceed 4 feet (1219 mm) on center in each direction, between floors and roof. A reinforcing element shall exist or be provided at or near the 
top of all stone masonry walls. 8-805.2.3 Testing of stone masonry. Testing of stone masonry shall be similar to the 2010 CEBC requirements
