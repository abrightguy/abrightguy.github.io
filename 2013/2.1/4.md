SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON USE AND OCCUPANCY


opening, food court or other obstruction to means of egress travel.
402.8.2 Determination of occupant load. The occupant load permitted in any individual tenant space in a covered or open mall building shall be determined as required by thiscode. Means of egress requirements for individual tenant spaces shall be based on the occupant load thus determined.
402.8.2.1 Occupant formula. In determining required means of egress of the mall, the number of occupants for whom means of egress are to be provided shall be based on gross leasable area of the covered or open mall building (excluding anchor buildings) and the occupant load factor as determined by Equation 4-1.
OLF = (0.00007) (GIA) + 25 (Equation 4-1)
where:
OLF = The occupant load factor (square feet per person).
GIA = The gross leasable area (square feet).
Exception: Tenant spaces attached to a covered or open mall building but with a means of egress system that is totally independent of the open mall of an open mall building or of a covered mall building shall not be considered as gross leasable area for determining the required means of egress for the mall building.
402.8.2.2 OLF range. The occupant load factor (OLF) is not required to be less than 30 and shall not exceed
50.
402.8.2.3 Anchor buildings. The occupant load of anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be included in computing the total number of occupants for the mall.
402.8.2.4 Food courts. The occupant load of a food court shall be determined in accordance with Section 1004. For the purposes of determining the means of egress requirements for the mall, the food court occupant load shall be added to the occupant load of the covered or open mall building as calculated above.

402.8.3 Number of means of egress. Wherever the distance of travel to the mall from any location within a tenant space used by persons other than employees is greater than 75 feet (22 860 mm) or the tenant space has an occupant load of 50 or more, no fewer than two means of egress shall be provided.
402.8.4 Arrangements of means of egress. Assembly occupancies with an occupant load of 500 or more located within a covered mall building shall be so located such that their entrance will be immediately adjacent to a principal entrance to the mall and shall have not less than onehalf of their required means of egress opening directly to the exterior of the covered mall building. Assembly occupancies located within the perimeter line of an open mall building shall be permitted to have their main exit open to the open mall.

402.8.4.1 Anchor building means of egress. Required means of egress for anchor buildings shall be provided independently from the mall means of egress system. The occupant load of anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be included in determining means of egress requirements for the mall. The path of egress travel of malls shall not exit through anchor buildings. Malls terminating at an anchor building where no other means of egress has been provided shall be considered as a dead-end mall.
402.8.5 Distance to exits. Within  each individual tenant space in a covered or open mall building, the distance of travel from any point to an exit or entrance to the mall shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm).
The distance of travel from any point within a mall of a covered mall building to an exit shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm). The maximum distance of travel from any point within an open mall to the perimeter line of the open mall building shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm).
402.8.6 Access to exits. Where more than one exit is required, they shall be so arranged that it is possible to travel in either direction from any point in a mall of a covered mall building to separate exits or from any point in an open mall of an open mall building to two separate locations on the perimeter line, provided neither location is an exterior wall of an anchor building or parking garage. The width of an exit passageway or corridor from a mall shall be not less than 66 inches (1676 mm).



Exception: Access to exits are permitted by way of a dead-end mall which does not exceed a length equal to twice the width of the mall measured at the narrowest location within the dead-end portion of the mall.


402.8.6.1 Exit passageways. Where exit passageways provide a secondary means of egress from a tenant space, doorways to the exit passageway shall be protected by 1-hour fire door assemblies that are self-or automatic-closing by smoke detection in accordance with Section 716.5.9.3.
402.8.7 Service areas fronting on exit passageways.
Mechanical rooms, electrical rooms, building service areas and service elevators are permitted to open directly into exit passageways, provided the exit passageway is separated from such rooms with not less than 1-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711, or both. The fire protection rating of openings in the fire barriers shall be not less than 1 hour.
402.8.8 Security grilles and doors. Horizontal sliding or vertical security grilles or doors that are a part of a required means of egress shall conform to the following:
1.
They shall remain in the full open position during the period of occupancy by the general public.

2.

3.
The doors or grilles shall be openable from within without the use of any special knowledge or effort where the space is occupied.

4.
Where two or more exits are required, not more than one-half of the exits shall be permitted to include either a horizontal sliding or vertical rolling grille or door.


SECTION 403
HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS AND GROUP I-2
OCCUPANCIES HAVING OCCUPIED
FLOORS LOCATED MORE THAN 75 FEET
ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF FIRE
DEPARTMENT VEHICLE ACCESS

403.1 Applicability. New high-rise buildings and new Group I-2 occupancies having occupied floors located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access shall comply with Sections 403.2 through 403.7.
Exception: The provisions of Sections 403.2 through
403.6 shall not apply to the following buildings and structures:
1.
Airport traffic control towers in accordance with Section 412.3.

2.
Open parking garages in accordance with Section

3.
Buildings with a Group A-5 occupancy in accordance with Section 303.6.

4.
Special industrial occupancies in accordance with Section 503.1.1.

5.
Buildings such as power plants, lookout towers, steeples, grain houses and similar structures with noncontinuous human occupancy, when so determined by the enforcing agency.


406.5.
For existing high-rise buildings, see Section 3414 and for existing Group R occupancies, see Section 3413.13.

433.3 Access and exit facilities.
433.3.1 Occupant load. The occupant load for a transit station shall be based on the emergency condition requiring evacuation of that station to a point of safety. The station occupant load shall be the sum of the number of persons in the calculated train load of trains entering a station plus the entraining load of persons awaiting train(s), during a specified time period. Notwithstanding, the minimum occupant load shall not be less than the maximum capacity load of a train which would occupy the entire length of the station platform on a single track. Exiting shall be provided for occupant loads recalculated upon increase in service and/ or every five years.
433.3.1.1 Calculated train load. The calculated train load is the number of passengers on trains simultaneously entering the station on all tracks in normal traffic direction during the peak 15-minute period.
The following limitations to the calculated train load shall be applied:
1.
No more than one train will unload at any one track to a platform during an emergency.

2.
The load on any single train is limited to the maximum train capacity.


433.3.1.2 Entraining load (on platform awaiting train). The entraining load is equal to the number of passengers that would accumulate on the platform in the time period equivalent to two headways or 12 minutes during the peak 15-minute period, whichever time period is greater.
This entraining load is constrained as stated as follows:
1.
Special consideration shall be given to stations servicing areas where events occur that establish occupant loads not included in normal passenger loads. These would include such areas as civic centers, sports complexes and convention centers.

2.
At multiplatform stations, each platform shall be considered separately. Arrival of trains from all normal traffic directions, plus their entraining loads, shall be considered.

3.
At concourses, mezzanines or multilevel stations, simultaneous platform loads shall be considered for all exit lanes passing through that area.


433.3.2 Exits required.
433.3.2.1 Number of exits. Stations shall have at least two exits placed a distance apart equal to not less than one half of the length of the maximum overall diagonal dimension of the station. Enclosed station platforms shall have a minimum of one exit within 20 feet (6096 mm) from each end. Underground station platforms shall have a minimum of one enclosed exit within 20 feet (6096 mm) from each end. Routes from platform ends into the underground guideway shall not be considered as exits for calculating exiting requirements.
433.3.2.2 Capacity of exits and station evacuation time.
433.3.2.2.1 Exit capacities shall be calculated on the basis of 22-inch-wide (559 mm) exit lanes at the clear and narrowest point except that individual handrails may project into the required width as permitted by Chapter 10. Fractional lanes shall not be counted in measuring exit capacities except that 12 inches (305 mm) added to one or more lanes shall be counted as one-half a lane. Escalators 32 inches (813 mm) in width may be considered as 11/2 lanes.
433.3.2.2.2 There shall be sufficient means of exit to evacuate the station occupant load from the station platforms in four minutes or less.
433.3.2.2.3 The station shall also be designed to permit evacuation from the most remote point on the platform to a point of safety in six minutes or less.
433.3.2.2.4 In at-grade or elevated structures so designed that the station platform is open to the elements and, when the concourse is below or protected from the platform by distance or materials as determined by an appropriate engineering analysis, that concourse may be defined as a point of safety, with Fire Code Official concurrence.
433.3.2.2.5 To calculate evacuation time, the walking travel time should be tabulated using the longest exit route and travel speeds. To this time should be added the following factors:
1.
The waiting time at the vertical elements at platform level minus the longest walking travel time at platform level.

2.
