Where the existing roof 	or roof covering is water soaked or has deteriorated to the point that the existing roof or roof covering is not adequate as a base for additional roofing.

2.
Where the existing roof covering is wood shake, slate, clay, cement or asbestos-cement tile.

3.
Where the existing roof has two or more applications of any type of roof covering.


Exceptions:
1.
Complete and separate roofing systems, such as standing-seam metal roof systems, that are designed to transmit the roof loads directly to the buildings structural system and that do not rely on existing roofs and roof coverings for support, shall not require the removal of existing roof coverings.

2.
Metal panel, metal shingle and concrete and clay tile roof coverings shall be permitted to be installed over existing wood shake roofs when applied in accordance with Section 1510.4.

3.
The application of a new protective coating over an existing spray polyurethane foam roofing system shall be permitted without tear-off of existing roof coverings.

1510.4 Roof recovering. Where the application of a new roof covering over wood shingle or shake roofs creates a combustible concealed space, the entire existing surface shall be covered with gypsum board, mineral fiber, glass fiber or other approved materials securely fastened in place.
1510.5 Reinstallation of materials. Existing slate, clay or cement tile shall be permitted for reinstallation, except that damaged, cracked or broken slate or tile shall not be reinstalled. Existing vent flashing, metal edgings, drain outlets, collars and metal counterflashings shall not be reinstalled where rusted, damaged or deteriorated. Aggregate surfacing materials shall not be reinstalled.
1510.6 Flashings. Flashings shall be reconstructed in accordance with approved manufacturers installation instructions. Metal flashing to which bituminous materials are to be adhered shall be primed prior to installation.
SECTION 1511
SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS/MODULES

1511.1 Solar photovoltaic panels/modules. Solar photovoltaic panels/modules installed upon a roof or as an integral part of a roof assembly shall comply with the requirements of this code (see Section 3111) and the California Fire Code.
1511.1.1 Structural fire resistance. The structural frame and roof construction supporting the load imposed upon the roof by the photovoltaic panels/modules shall comply with the requirements of Table 601 and Section 602.1.
