Exceptions:
1 . 	Outdoor areas used exclusively for service of the building need only have one means of egress.
2. Both outdoor areas associated with Group R-3 and individual dwelling units of Group R-2.

Where stairways serve more than one story, only the occupant load of each story considered individually shall be used in calculating the required capacity of the stairways serving that story.
Exceptions:
1. 	For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches (mm), of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairway by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch (5 .1 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 and an emergency
