More than 70 feet ofsoft clays or silts characterized by a shear wave velocity less than 400 feet oer second.  1.2 1.5 2.0

2.1.2 Data collection. Building information pertinent to a structure's seismic performance, including condition, configuration, detailing, material strengths and foundation type, shall be obtained in accordance with this section, and documented on drawings and/or sketches that shall be included with the structural calculations.
Exception: Materials testing is not required for reclassification by the collapse probability assessment option as permitted by Section 1.4.5.1.2, where nonavailability of materials test is identified as a deficiency per Section
1.4.5.1.2.2.2.2
(b).

2.1.2.1
Building characteristics. Characteristics of the building relevant to its seismic performance shall be obtained for use in the building evaluation. This shall include current information on the building's condition, configuration, material strengths, detailing and foundation type. This data shall be obtained from:


1.
Review of construction documents;

2.
Destructive and nondestructive testing and examination of selected building components; and

3.
Field observation of exposed conditions.


The characteristics of the building shall be established, including identification of the gravity-and lateral-load-catTying systems. The effective lateral-load canying system may include structural and nonstructural elements that will participate in providing lateral resistance, although these elements may not have intended to provide lateral resistance. The load path shall be identified, taking into account the effects of any modifications, alterations or additions.
2.1.2.1.1 Nonconforming buildings without construction documents. Where the available construction documents do not provide sufficient detail to characterize the structure, the evaluation may be based on field surveys, summarized in as-built drawings. These drawings must depict building dimensions, component sizes, reinforcing information (for concrete and masonry elements), connection details, footing information, and the proximity of neighboring structures. All parts of the building that may contribute to the seismic resistance or that may be affected by the seismic response of the structure must be identified. The field survey shall establish the physical existence of the structural members, and identify critical load bearing members, transfer mechanisms, and connections. The survey shall include information on the structural elements and connector materials and details. Performing the field survey will entail removal of fireproofing or concrete encasement at critical locations to permit direct visual inspection and measurement of elements and connections. Nondestructive techniques such as radiographic, electromagnetic and other methods may be used to supplement destructive techniques.
1.
Steel elements. Steel elements shall be classified by structural member type (e.g., rolled or build-up, material grade, and general properties). The survey shall note the presence of degradation or indications of plastic deformation, integrity of surface coatings, and signs of any past movement. For degraded elements, the lost material thickness and reduction of cross-sectional area and moment of inertia shall be determined. Visual inspection of welds shall be per American Welding Society D 1.1, "Structural Welding Code-Steel." Structural bolts shall be verified to be in proper configuration and tightened as required in the AISC Steel Construction Manual. Rivets shall also be verified to be in proper configuration and in full contact, with "hammer sounding" conducted on random rivets to ensure they are functional. Nondestructive testing methods, such as dye penetrant and magnetic particle testing, acoustic emission, radiography and ultrasound shall be used when visual inspection identifies degradation or when a particular element or connection is critical to seismic resistance and requires further verification. For buildings in which archaic cast and wrought irons are employed, additional investigations to confirm ductility and impact resistance shall be conducted.

2.
Concrete elements. The configuration and dimensions of primary and secondary structural elements shall be established. The configuration and condition ofreinforcing steel shall be assessed, through removal of concrete cover and direct visual inspection, and through nondestructive inspection using electromagnetic, radiographic and other methods. Critical parameters of the reinforcing system, such as lap splice length, presence of hooks, development within concrete, degree of corrosion and integrity of the construction shall be established in sufficient detail to perform the structural evaluation.


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
3.
Masonry elements. The configuration and dimensions ofmasonry elements shall be established. The configuration and condition of reinforcing-steel shall be assessed, through removal of masonry cover and direct visual inspection, and through nondestructive inspection using electromagnetic, radiographic and other methods. Critical parameters of the reinforcing system, such as lap splice length, presence of hooks, development within concrete, degree of corrosion and integrity of the construction shall be established in sufficient detail to perform the structural evaluation.

4.
Wood elements. The configuration and dimensions of wood elements; the connections between wood elements; and the connections between wood and other structural components or elements such as concrete or masonry walls shall be established. The configuration and condition of wood members, including size, type, grade, condition and quality shall be assessed, through removal of finish materials, and examination of unfinished areas such as attics, crawl spaces and basements. Critical connections and elements shall be visually inspected, using invasive procedures or removal of finishes where necessary. For shear walls, select locations shall be exposed to allow evaluation of sheathing material, nail size, spacing and installation (e.g., overdriven or nails that miss or split the framing members). The base connections of shear resisting elements shall be inspected and evaluated for their adequacy to connect the base ofthe structure to the foundation or structure below.

5.
Foundation elements. In the absence of dependable construction drawings, determination of the size and detailing of the foundation system requires invasive procedures. The evaluator shall select representative footings for exposure to establish footing size and depth. Conservative assumptions regarding the reinforcement may be made considering code requirements and local practice at the time of the design. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that the foundation elements were adequately designed to resist actual gravity loads to which the building has been subjected.



2.1.2.2 Material properties. The building evaluation shall be based on the strength and deformation properties of the existing materials and components. The strength ofexisting components shall be calculated using data on their configuration, obtained from the original construction documents, supplemented by field observations and the test values of material properties. Where such effects may have a deleterious effect on component or structural behavior, allowances shall be made for the likely effects ofstrain hardening or degradation. Test values may be obtained from samples extracted from the structure, or from original materials and compliance certificates. The Office will determine the adequacy of the testing program.
2.1.2.2.1 Nonconforming buildings with construction documents. The material properties for nonconforming buildings for which original construction documents of sufficient detail are available shall be confirmed by testing or from acceptable
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
original materials and compliance certificates. If original materials and compliance certificates are available, they must provide the information specified in Items 1 through 4 of this section to be considered acceptable.
1. 	Steel elements. The following properties are required for each member type (e.g., beams, columns, braces) and each steel grade used in the structure:
a) 	Ultimate tensile and yield capacities;
b) Modulus of elasticity; and
c) 	Deformation characteristics including mode of failure.

2. 	Concrete elements. The following material properties are required for each member type (e.g., beams, columns, walls) in the structure:
a) Concrete compressive strength;
b) Concrete unit weight;
c) Concrete modulus of elasticity;
d) Reinforcing steel tensile yield point;
e) Reinforcing steel modulus of elasticity;
f) Reinforcing steel chemical composition and car

bon equivalent; and g) Reinforcing steel surface deformations.

3.
Masonry elements. The following material properties are required for each type of masonry in the structure: a) Masonry compressive strength; b) Masonry unit weight; c) Masonry modulus of elasticity; d) Reinforcing steel tensile yield point; e) Reinforcing steel modulus of elasticity; f) Reinforcing steel chemical composition and car

bon equivalent; and g) Reinforcing steel surface deformations.


4.
Wood elements. The following material properties are required for each type ofwood element in the structure:


a) 	Identification of Wood Species, and
b) Grade Material. (Note: This may be established by visual inspection or stamped labels on the element.)

2.1.2.2.2 Nonconforming buildings without construction documents. The material properties for nonconforming buildings for which original construction documents of sufficient detail are unavailable shall be confirmed by testing. The number and location of tests shall be selected so as to provide sufficient information to adequately define the existing condition of materials in the building. The evaluator shall determine the number and location of tests. The test locations shall be located throughout the entire building in those components which provide the primary path of lateral force resistance.
2.2 Selection and use of evaluation statements.
2.2.1 Identification of building type. The evaluator shall determine the building type using the following procedure:
1.
Identify the lateral-force-resisting system using text and drawings, including whatever components are available and effective to constitute a system. Prepare floor and roof plans, and elevations and sketches of the lateral-force-resisting system.

2.
Select one or more of the 15 common building types which best characterize the structure (see Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 below). Structures with multiple lateral force resisting systems (different lateral systems in orthogonal directions, or structures where the system changes from level to level) may require the use of two or more building types. In the case of hybrid structures or other buildings that cannot be adequately classified using the 15 building types, the alternative analysis procedure shall be used, or the building shall be placed in SPC "1."

3.
Reproduce from the Appendix the list of evaluation statements. These statements shall be used for all types of buildings. Some statements on the list may not be appropriate. These statements may be marked "NA" as "not applicable." The Appendix also contains the set of evaluation statements that address foundations and geologic site hazards, and nonstructural elements.


2.2.2 Using the general procedure. The general procedure involving use of the set of evaluation statements presented in the Appendix consists of the following steps:
1.
Evaluate the basic building system according to the evaluation statements in Article 3;

2.
Evaluate the vertical systems resisting lateral forces according to Article 4 (moment frames), Article 5 (shear walls) or Article 6 (braced frames) as appropriate. For buildings with a combination of vertical systems, each system in the building must be evaluated;

3.
Evaluate the diaphragm or horizontal bracing system according to Article 7;

4.
Evaluate the structural connections according to Article 8;

5.
Evaluate the foundation and possible geologic site hazards according to Article 9;

6.
Evaluate the nonstructural elements that involve immediate life-safety issues according to Article 10; and

7.
Evaluate the critical nonstructural components and systems according to Article 11.


Ifa statement is found to be true, the condition being evaluated is acceptable according to the criteria of these regulations, and the issue may be set aside. If a statement is found to be false, a condition exists that needs to be addressed further, using the specified analysis procedures. Analysis procedures are given in Section 2.4. Each statement includes a reference to a particular section in Articles 3 through 10 where additional procedures for the resolution of the issues are given. The evaluator shall assemble the list of deficiencies and the results of the analysis and proceed to the final evaluation in Section 2.5.
2.2.3 Common building types. The evaluator shall determine the type(s) of building being evaluated, choosing from among the following 15 common types:
1.
Building Type 1-Wood, light frame. These buildings are typically small structures of one or more stories. The essential structural character of this type is repetitive framing by wood joists on wood studs. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with veneer. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors. Shear walls are exterior walls sheathed with plank siding, stucco, plywood, gypsum board, particle board or fiberboard. Interior partitions are sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.

2.
Building Type 2-Wood, commercial and industrial. These are buildings with a floor area of 5,000 square feet or more and with few, if any, interior bearing walls. The essential structural character is framing by beams on columns. The beams may be glulam beams, steel beams or trusses. Lateral forces usually are resisted by wood diaphragms and exterior walls sheathed with plywood, stucco, plaster or other paneling. The walls may have rod bracing. Large exterior wall openings often require post-and-beam framing. Lateral force resistance on those lines may be achieved with steel rigid frames or diagonal bracing.

3.
Building Type 3-Steel moment frame. These buildings have a frame of steel columns and beams. Lateral forces are resisted by the development of flexural forces in the beams and columns. In some cases, the beam-column connections have very small moment resisting capacity but, in other cases, the connections of some of the beams and columns were designed to fully develop the member capacities. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to moment resisting frames. The diaphragms can be of almost any material. The frames develop their stiffness by full or partial moment connections. The frames can be located almost anywhere in the building. Usually the columns have their strong directions oriented so that some columns act primarily in one direction while the others act in the other direction, and the frames consist of lines of strong columns and their intervening beams.

4.
Building Type 4-Steel braced frame. These buildings are similar to Type 3 buildings except that the vertical components of the lateral-force-resisting system are braced frames rather than moment frames.

5.
Building Type 5-Steellight frame. These buildings are pre-engineered and prefabricated with transverse rigid frames. The roof and walls consist of lightweight panels. The frames are built in segments and assembled in the field with bolted joints. Lateral loads in the transverse direction are resisted by the rigid frames with loads distributed to them by shear elements. Loads in the longitudinal direction are resisted entirely by shear elements. The shear elements can be either the roof and wall sheathing panels, an independent system of ten


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
sion-only rod bracing, or a combination of panels and bracing.
6.
Building Type 6-Steel frame with concrete shear walls. The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms of almost any material to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In "dual" systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls in proportion to their relative rigidities. In this case, the walls would be evaluated under this building type and the frames would be evaluated under Type 3, Steel Moment Frames.

7.
Building Type 7-Steel frame with infill shear walls. This is one of the older type of buildings. The infill walls usually are offset from the exterior frame members, wrap around them, and present a smooth masonry exterior with no indication of the frame. Solidly infilled masonry panels act as a diagonal compression strut between the intersections of the moment frame. Ifthe walls do not fully engage the frame members (i.e., lie in the same plane), the diagonal compression struts will not develop. The peak strength of the diagonal strut is determined by the tensile stress capacity of the masonry panel. The post-cracking strength is determined by an analysis of a moment frame that is partially restrained by the cracked infill. The analysis shall be based on published research and shall treat the system as a composite of a frame and the infill. An analysis that attempts to treat the system as a frame and shear wall is not permitted.

8.
Building Type 8-Concrete moment frame. These buildings are similar to Type 3 buildings except that the frames are of concrete. There is a large variety of frame systems. Older buildings may have frame beams that have broad shallow cross sections or are simply the column strips of flat-slabs.

9.
Building Type 9-Concrete shear walls. The vertical components of the lateral-force-resisting system in these buildings are concrete shear walls that are usually bearing walls. In older buildings, the walls often are quite extensive and the wall stresses are low but reinforcing is light. Remodeling that entailed adding or enlarging the openings for windows and doors may critically alter the strength of the modified walls. In newer buildings, the shear walls often are limited in extent, generating the need for boundary members and additional design consideration of overturning forces.

10.
Building Type 10-Concrete frame with infill shear walls. These hnilciines :we similar to Type 7 buildings except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. The analysis of this building is similar to that recommended for Type 7 except that the shear strength of the concrete columns, after cracking ofthe infill, may limit the semi-



SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
ductile behavior of the system. Research that is specific to confinement of the infill by reinforced concrete frames shall be used for the analysis.

11.
Building Type 11-Precast/tilt-up concrete walls with lightweight flexible diaphragm. These buildings have a wood or metal deck roof diaphragm that distributes lateral forces to precast concrete shear walls. The walls are thin but relatively heavy while the roofs are relatively light. Tilt-up buildings often have more than one story. Walls can have numerous openings for doors and windows of such size that the wall behaves more like a frame than a shear wall.

12.
Building Type 12-Precast concrete frames with concrete shear walls. These buildings contain floor and roof diaphragms typically composed of precast concrete elements with or without cast-in-place concrete topping slabs. The diaphragms are supported by precast concrete girders and columns. The girders often bear on column corbels. Closure strips between precast floor elements and beam-column joints usually are cast-in-place concrete. Welded steel inserts often are used to interconnect precast elements. Lateral loads are resisted by precast or cast-in-place concrete shear walls.

13.
Building Type 13-Reinforced masonry bearing walls with wood or metal deck diaphragms. These buildings have perimeter bearing walls of reinforced brick or concrete-block masonry. These walls are the vertical elements in the lateral-force-resisting system. The floors and roofs are framed either with wood joists and beams with plywood or straight or diagonal sheathing or with steel beams with metal deck with or without a concrete fill. Wood floor framing is supported by interior wood posts or steel columns; steel beams are supported by steel columns.

14.
Building Type 14-Reinforced masonry bearing walls with precast concrete diaphragms. These buildings have bearing walls similar to those of Type 13 buildings, but the roof and floors are composed of precast concrete elements such as planks or tee-beams, and the precast roof and floor elements are supported on interior beams and columns of steel or concrete (cast-in-place or precast). The precast horizontal elements may have a cast-in-place topping.

15.
Building Type 15-Unreinforced masonry (URM) bearing wall buildings. These buildings include structural elements that vary depending on the building's age and, to a lesser extent, its geographic location. In buildings built before 1900, the majority of floor and roof construction consists of wood sheathing supported by wood subframing. In large multistory buildings, the floors are cast-in-place concrete supported by the unreinforced masonry walls and/or steel or concrete interior framing. In buildings built after 1950, unreinforced masonry buildings with wood floors usually have plywood rather than board sheathing. The perimeter walls, and possibly some interior walls, are unreinforced masonry. The walls may or may not be


anchored to the diaphragms. Ties between the walls and diaphragms are more common for the bearing walls than for walls that are parallel to the floor framing. Unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings (TYPE 15) shall be assigned to SPC 1. No further analysis is required.

2.3 Follow-up field work. The first assessment of the evaluation statements may indicate a need for more information about the building. The evaluator shall make additional site visits, performing the necessary surveys and tests to complete the evaluation.
2.4 Analysis of the building. The general requirements for building analysis (including the determination of force level, horizontal distribution of lateral forces, accidental torsion, interstory drift and overturning) are summarized in this section. For cases where dynamic analysis is required, the general requirements are given in Section 2.4.10.
2.4.1 Scope of analysis. When an evaluation statement is false and requires further analysis, the evaluator shall provide appropriate analyses that will cover the statement requirements. For the analysis, the evaluator will:
1.
Calculate the building weights;

2.
Calculate the building period;

3.
Calculate the lateral force on the building;

4.
Distribute the lateral force over the height of the building;

5.
Calculate the story shears and overturning moments;

6.
Distribute the story shears to the vertical resisting elements in proportion to their relative stiffness;

7.
Examine the individual elements as required by the evaluation statements:


a.
Load and reaction diagrams for diaphragms and for the vertical resisting elements;

b.
Shearing stresses 	and chord forces in the diaphragm;

c.
Vertical components (walls and frames) and find the story deflections, member forces and deflections; and

d.
Total forces or deflections according to the specified load combinations.



For moment frames consisting of beams and columns, the distribution ofstory shears to the vertical lateral-force-resisting elements in that story may be in proportion to their relative stiffness. In multistory frame-shear wall structures or in structures where the vertical resisting elements have significantly different lateral stiffnesses, or where the stiffnesses ofthe vertical resisting elements change significantly over the height of the structure, an analysis of the entire structure under the prescribed lateral loads shall be performed.
2.4.2 Demand. All building components evaluated shall resist the effects of the seismic forces prescribed herein and the effects of gravity loadings from dead, floor live and snow loads. The following load combinations shall be used:
Q= 1.1 QD+ QL +QsQE (2-1)
or (2-2)

where:
Q = 	the effect of the combined loads.
Qv = 	the effect of dead load.
QE = the effect of seismic forces.
QL = 	the effective live load is equal to 25 percent of the unreduced design live load but not less than the actual live load.
Q8 = the effective snow load is equal to either 70 percent of the full design snow load or, where conditions warrant and are approved by OSHPD, not less than 20 percent of the full design snow load except that, where the design snow load is less than 30 pounds per square foot, no part ofthe load need be included in seismic loading.
The seismic portion of the demand (QE) is obtained from analysis of the building using the seismic base shear (V) from Equation 2-3.
2.4.3 Seismic analysis of the building.
2.4.3.1 Base shear. The seismic base shear determined from Equation 2-3 is the basic seismic demand on the building. Element forces and deflections obtained from analysis based on this demand are the element demands (QE) to be used in the load combinations of Equations 2-1 and 2-2. The demands are modified in some cases as discussed in Section 2.4.11.
The seismic base shear (V) in a given direction shall be determined as follows:
V=C,W 	(2-3)
where:

Cs = the seismic design coefficient determined by Equation 2-4 or 2-5.
W = the total dead load and applicable portions of the following:

In storage and warehouse occupancies, a minimum of 25 percent of the floor live;


Where an allowance for partition load is included in the floor load design, the actual partition weight or a minimum weight of 10 psf of floor area, whichever is greater;


Total operating weight of all permanent equipment; and


The effective snow load as defined in Section 2.4.2.

where:
Av 	the peak velocity-related acceleration coefficient given in Figures 2.1 and 2.1 a.
R = a response modification coefficient from Table 2.4.3 .1.
S = the site coefficient given in Table 2.1. In locations where the soil properties are not known in sufficient detail to determine the Soil Profile Type S3 shall be used. Soil Profile Type S4 need not be assumed unless OSHPD determines that Soil Profile Type S4 may be present at the site, or in the event the Soil Profile Type S4 is established by the geotechnical engineer.
T = the fundamental period of the building.
The value of C, need not be greater than:
C = O.S5(2.5 Aa) = 2.12Aa
(2-5)
' R R

where:
Aa = the effective peak acceleration coefficient given in Figures 2.1 and 2.1a.
2.4.3.2 Period. For use in Equation 2-4, the value ofT shall be calculated using one of the following methods:
Method 1. The value of T may be taken to be equal to the approximate fundamental period of the building (T) determined as follows:
a. For buildings in which the lateral-force-resisting system consists of moment-resisting frames capable of resisting 100 percent of the required lateral force and such frames are not enclosed or adjoined by more rigid components tending to prevent the frames from deflecting when subjected to seismic forces:

(2-6a)

where:
Cr = 0.035 for steel frames.
Cr = 0.030 for concrete frames.
h" = 	the height in feet above the base to the highest level of the building.
h. As an alternate for concrete and steel moment-resisting-frame buildings of 12 stories or fewer with a minimum story height of 10 feet, the equation Ta =0.10N, where N= the number of stories, may be used in lieu of Equation 2-6a.

where:

T = 2:rr L.(w A2)
(2-7)
gL.(!;d;)

The values of.f represent any lateral force, associated with weights wi, distributed approximately in accordance with the principles of Equations 2-8, 2-9 and 2-10 or any other rational distribution. The elastic deflections, d;, should be calculated using the applied lateral forces, .f. The period used for computation of C, shall not exceed CaTa, where Ca is given in Table
2.4.3.2.
2.4.3.3 Direction of seismic forces. Assume that seismic forces will come from any horizontal direction. The forces may be assumed to act nonconcurrently in the direction ofeach principal axis of the structure except as discussed in Section
2.4.3.5.
2.4.3.4 Uplift. The beneficial effects of uplift at the foundation soil level may be considered, using the alternative analysis procedure.
2.4.3.5 Orthogonal effects. The critical load effect due to direction of application of seismic forces on the building may be assumed to be satisfied if components and their foundations are designed for the following combination of prescribed loads: 100 percent of the forces for one direction plus 30 percent of the forces for the perpendicular direction. The combination requiring the maximum component strength should be used.
Exception: Diaphragms and components of the seismic resisting system utilized in only one of the two orthogonal directions need not be designed for the combined effects.
2.4.3.6 Combinations ofstructural systems. When combinations of structural systems are incorporated into the same structure, the following requirements shall be satisfied:
1. 	Vertical combinations.
1.1 	Structures not having the same structural system throughout their height shall be evaluated using the dynamic lateral force procedure.
Exceptions:
1.
Structures five stories or less without stiffness and strength irregularities may be evaluated using the equivalent lateral force procedures; and

2.
Structures conforming to Section 2.4.3.6.2, below.



1.2
A two-stage analysis may be used if a structure contains a relatively rigid base supporting a flexible upper portion and both portions considered separately can be classified as regular structures. The rigid base shall have a calculated natural period in each direction of not more than 0.06 seconds. The periods shall be evaluated using Eq. 2-7, or its equivalent, considering the total mass of the flexible upper portion concentrated at the top of the rigid base. The flexible upper portion shall be evaluated as a separate structure supported laterally by the rigid base. The rigid base shall be evaluated as a separate structure. The reactions of the flexible upper portion shall be applied at the top of the rigid base, amplified by the ratio of the Rand Cd factors of the superstructure divided by those for the base structure. The values of R and Cd for the base structure shall be greater than or equal to those used for the superstructure. The total lateral force on the base shall include the forces determined for the base itself.

2.
Combinations along different axes. If a building has a bearing wall system in only one direction, the value of R used for systems in the other direction shall not be greater than that used for the bearing wall system.


2.4.3.7 Vertical distribution of forces. The lateral force (F), induced at any level, shall be determined as follows:

(2-8) and (2-9)
where:

Cvx 	= vertical distribution factor.
h;and

h, 	= the height (feet) from the base to Level I or x.
k = an exponent related to the building period as follows: For buildings having a period of 0.5 second or less, k = 1.
For buildings having a period of2.5 seconds or more, k= 2.
For buildings having a period between 0.5 and 2.5 seconds, k may be taken as 2 or may be determined by linear interpolation between 1 and 2.
V = total design lateral force or shear at the base of the building.
w;and

w, = the portion of the total gravity load of the building (W) located or assigned to Level I or x.
2.4.3.8 Horizontal distribution of shear. The story shear, (V), shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral-force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the diaphragm.
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
2.4.3.9 Horizontal torsional moments. The increased shears resulting from horizontal torsion where diaphragms have the capability to transmit that torsion shall be evaluated. The accidental torsional moment shall be determined assuming displacements of the centers of mass each way from their calculated locations. The minimum assumed displacement of the center of mass at each level shall be five percent of the dimension at that level measured perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. For each element, the most severe loading shall be considered.
2.4.3.10 Overturning. Every structure shall be capable of resisting the overturning effects caused by earthquake forces specified. At any level, the overturning moments to be resisted shall be estimated using those seismic forces (F, and Fx) that act on levels above the level under consideration. At any level, the incremental changes of the overturning moment shall be distributed to the various resisting elements in the same proportion as distribution of the horizontal shears to those elements. The foundations of buildings (but not the connection of the building to the foundation), except inverted pendulum structures, shall be evaluated for the foundation overturning design moment (M1) at the foundation-soil interface determined using the overturning moment at the base with an overturning moment reduction factor of 0.75.
2.4.3.11 P-delta effects. The resulting member forces and moments and the story drifts induced by P-delta effects shall be considered in the evaluation of overall structural frame stability. P-delta need not be considered if the drift satisfies the "Quick Check for Drift" given in Section 2.4.7.
2.4.3.12 Foundations. The foundation shall be capable of transmitting the base shear and the overturning forces defined in this article from the structure into the supporting soil. The short-term dynamic nature of the loads may be taken into account in establishing the soil properties.
2.4.3.12.1 Soil capacities. The capacity of the foundation soil in bearing or the capacity of the soil interface between pile, pier or caisson and the soil shall be sufficient to support the structure with all prescribed loads, other than earthquake forces, taking due account of the settlement that the structure is capable of withstanding. For the load combination including earthquake, the soil capacities must be sufficient to resist loads at acceptable strains considering both the short time of loading and the dynamic properties of the soil. Allowable soil capacities multiplied by a factor of2.0 may be used, except that values for sliding friction may not be increased.
2.4.3.12.2 Structural materials. The strength of concrete foundation components subjected to seismic forces alone or in combination with other prescribed loads and their detailing requirements shall be determined from the provisions of ACI
318. Reductions to foundation component capacities shall be made where components do not meet the requirements of ACI
318.
2.4.4 Deformation and drift. When deformations and drift limits need to be checked, such as for frames failing the "Quick Check of Drift" and slender seismic resisting systems of any type, compute the elastic deformations caused by the required forces and then multiply by the factor cd to determine the total deformations. Interstory drifts shall not exceed O.Ol33hsx' where hsx is the story height below level x. For purposes of this drift analysis only, it is permissible to use the computed fundamental period <n of the building without the upper bound limitation specified in Section 2.4.3.2 when determining drift level seismic design forces.
2.4.5 Demand on diaphragms. The deflection in the plane of the diaphragm shall not exceed the permissible deflection of the attached elements as determined by the evaluator. Permissible deflection permits the attached element to maintain its structural integrity under the individual loading and continue to support the prescribed loads without endangering the occupants of the building.
Floor and roof diaphragms shall be designed to resist a minimum force equal to 0.5Av times the weight of the diaphragm and other elements attached to the building plus the portion of the seismic shear force at that level, (V,), required to be transferred to the components of the vertical seismic-resisting system because of offsets or changes in stiffness of the vertical components above and below the diaphragm.
Diaphragms shall provide for both the shear and bending stresses resulting from these forces. Diaphragms shall have ties or struts to distribute the wall anchorage forces into the diaphragm as prescribed in Section 3.6.4 ofthe 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions.
2.4.6 Demand on parts and portions of the building. Parts and portions ofstructures and permanent nonstructural components and equipment supported by a structure and their attachments, as identified in the building evaluation procedures, shall be evaluated to verify that they are capable of resisting the seismic forces specified below. All attachments or appendages, including anchorages and required bracing, shall be evaluated for seismic forces. Nomigid equipment, the structural failure of which would cause a life-safety hazard, also shall be evaluated.
Each element or component evaluated shall be capable of resisting a total lateral seismic force, FP, where:
FP=0.67(AvCcWc) (2-10)

where:
Av = 	the velocity-related acceleration coefficient given in Figures 2.1 and 2.1a.
Cc = 	a coefficient given in Table 2.4.6.
we = 	the weight of the element or component.
The NPC of the building shall be determined using the procedures in Article 11.

llj = 	total seismic dead load of all stories above Level j (see Section 2.4.1).
2.4.7.1 Story drift for moment Frames. The following equation for the drift ratio is applicable only to regular, multistory, multibay frames with columns continuous top and bottom:
DR=(~b:;:)C:E)vccd (2-12)

where:
Cd = deflection amplification factor from Table 2.4.3.1.

DR
= drift ratio = interstory displacement divided by interstory height. E = modulus of elasticity (ksi). h = story height (in.). I = moment of inertia (in.'). kb IlL for the beam. kc = I/h for the column. L center-to-center length (in.). Vc = shear in the column (kips).
For reinforced concrete frames, use appropriate cracked section properties pursuant to ACI 318-95 or later. For other configurations of frames, compute the drift ratio from the principles of structural mechanics.
2.4.7.2 Shearing stress in concrete frame columns. The equation for a quick estimate of the average shearing stress, (vav), in the columns of concrete frames is as follows:

Ac 	summation of the cross-sectional area of all columns in the story under consideration.
nc = 	total number of columns.
nf = 	total number of frames in the direction of loading.
Vj 	story shear from Equation 2-11.
Equation 2-13 assumes that nearly all of the columns in the frame have similar stiffness. For other configurations of frames, compute the shear stress in the concrete columns from the principles of structural mechanics.
2.4.7.3 Shearing stress in shear walls. The equation for a quick estimate of the average wall shear stress (vavg) is as follows:

(2-14)
where:

Aw = 	summation of the horizontal cross-sectional area of all shear walls in the direction of loading. The wall area shall be reduced by the area of any openings. For masonry walls, use the net area. For wood-framed walls, use the length rather than the area.
Vj = 	story shear at the level under consideration determined from Equation 2-11.
The allowable stresses for the various types of shear wall building are given in Section 5.1 for concrete shear walls, Sec

where:
Ab,. = the average area of a diagonal brace (in. 2).

s = average span length of braced spans (ft).
Vj = maximum story shear at each level (kips).
2.4.8 Procedure for evaluating unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings. Unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings shall automatically be placed in SPC 1.
2.4.9 Element capacities. Calculate element capacities on the ultimate-strength basis of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions.
When calculating capacities of deteriorated or damaged elements, the evaluator shall make appropriate reductions in the material strength, the section properties and any other aspects of the capacity affected by the deterioration.
2.4.9.1 Wood. The basic document is Chapter 9 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions, as modified in Section 5.6 of these regulations.
2.4.9.2 Steel. The basic document is Chapter 5 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions, as modified in Articles 4 and 6 of these regulations.
2.4.9.3 Concrete. The basic document is ACI 318-89. Because this document is on an ultimate-strength basis, the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions specifies special load factors that include the factor of 1.0 for earthquake effects (see Equations 2-1 and 2-2).
2.4.9.4 Masonry. The basic document is Chapter 8 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions, as modified in Article 5 of these regulations.
2.4.10 Dynamic analysis. Unless otherwise noted, the procedures given in Articles 3 through 10 use the equivalent lateral force procedure. The use of a dynamic analysis procedure is required for the following:
1) Buildings 240 feet or more in height;
2) Buildings wilh vcrlical irregularities caused by significant mass or geometric irregularities;

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
3) Buildings where the distribution of the lateral forces departs from that assumed in the equivalent lateral force procedure; and
4) Where required by the evaluation statements in Articles 3 through 10.
Dynamic analysis procedures shall conform to the criteria established in this section. The analysis shall be based on an appropriate ground motion representation as specified in this section and shall be performed using accepted principles of dynamics. Structures that are evaluated in accordance with this section shall comply with all other applicable requirements.
2.4.10.1 Ground motion. The ground motion representation shall be an elastic response spectra developed for mean values for the specific site, in accordance with the procedures in Title 24, Section 1629A.2 of 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC.
2.4.10.2 Mathematical model. A mathematical model of the physical structure shall represent the spatial distribution of the mass and stiffness ofthe structure to calculate the significant features of its dynamic response. A three-dimensional model shall be used when the dynamic analysis involves a structure with an irregular plan configuration and rigid or semirigid diaphragms.
2.4.10.3 Analysis procedure.
2.4.10.3.1 Response spectrum analysis. An elastic dynamic analysis of a structure shall use the peak dynamic response of all modes having a significant contribution to total structural response. This requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating that for the modes considered, at least 90% of the participating mass of the structure is included in the calculation of response in each principal horizontal direction. Peak modal responses are calculated using the ordinates of the appropriate response spectrum curve that corresponds to the modal periods. Maximum modal contributions shall be combined in a statistical manner using recognized combination methods to obtain an approximate total structural response.
2.4.10.3.2 Scaling of results. When the base shear for a given direction is less than that required by the equivalent lateral force procedure, the base shear shall be increased to the value prescribed in that procedure. All corresponding response parameters, including deflections, member forces and moments, shall be increased proportionately.
When the base shear for a given direction is greater than that required by the equivalent lateral force procedure, the base shear may be decreased to the value prescribed in that procedure. All corresponding response parameters, including deflections, member forces, and moments, may be decreased proportionately.
2.4.10.3.3 Post-yield analyses. Post-yield analyses of a simplified model of the building may be made to estimate the nonlinear displacements of the structural system. If the analyses is made with a two-dimensional planar model, the additive torsional displacement shall be established through methods that are equivalent to those used for response spectra analyses.
The displacements or rotations of structural members estimated by the post-yield analysis shall be compared with relevant experimental data to determine the adequacy of the member or system.
2.4.10.4 Torsion. The analysis shall account for torsional effects, including accidental torsional effects, as prescribed in Section 2.4.3.9. Where three-dimensional models are used for analysis, effects of accidental torsion shall be accounted for by appropriate adjustments in the model such as adjustment of mass locations or by equivalent static procedures such as provided in Section 2.4.3.9.
2.4.11 Acceptance criteria. The elements to be analyzed are specified in the procedures given in Articles 3 through 10. The total demand, Q, is calculated by Equation 2-1 or 2-2 as modified below. The capacity, C, is calculated according to the procedures of Section 2.4.9. The basic acceptance criterion is:
Q:::;;c 	(2-17)

Where elements or portions of a lateral force resisting system are expected to behave in a less ductile manner than the system as a whole, the term QE in Equation 2-1 or 2-2 shall be modified or special calculations be made to account for the different failure modes of the various elements. Modification of QE, and special calculation procedures and when they shall be used, are described in Articles 3 through 8.
If all significant elements meet the basic acceptance criteria as specified herein, no further analysis is needed.
2.4.12 Assessment of element deficiencies. The result of the checks specified in Articles 3 through 10 will show whether or not the elements meet the requirements of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions as modified herein.
For those elements not meeting the specified acceptance criteria, the relative hazard or seriousness of the deficiencies shall be assessed. Deficiencies shall be ranked according to:
1) Degrees of "overstress" (both total and seismic);
2) Element importance in the load path; and
3) Building, ductile and element stability.
2.5 Final evaluation.
2.5.1 Review the statements and responses. Upon completion of the analysis and field work, the evaluator shall review the evaluation statements and the responses to the statements to ensure that all of the concerns have been addressed.
2.5.2 Assemble and review the results of the procedures. Upon completion of the procedures given in Articles 3 through 10, the evaluator shall assemble and review the results.
2.5.2.1 Q versus C. The criterion Q C is an indication of whether an element meets the requirements of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions as modified for these regulations. However, because Q involves gravity effects, the ratio of Qto C for an element must be considered in light of the seismic demand versus capacity in order to fully determine the seriousness of the earthquake hazard.
2.5.2.2 DE /CE ratios. The severity of the deficiencies shall be assessed by listing the DE ICE ratios in descending order. The element with the largest value is the weakest link in the building. If the element can fail without jeopardizing the building, then the SPC may be based upon the element with the next lower ratio, and so on. Failure ofan element will not jeopardize the building provided an alternate load path (neglecting the failed element) exists, and the vertical and lateral stability of the structure, or portions of the structure, is not impaired. The presence of an element with a DEICE greater than one, where failure of that element will jeopardize the stability of the building or element, requires that nonconforming buildings be placed in SPC 1. For conforming buildings, see the appropriate evaluation statement.
2.5.2.3 Qualitative issues. Some of the procedures identify specific deficiencies without any calculation. These deficiencies will automatically place buildings in SPC 1, 3 or 4.
2.5.3 Final evaluation. The final evaluation will place the building in the appropriate the SPC (Table 2.5.3), based on a review of the qualitative and quantitative results of the procedures and the list of deficiencies. In general, an unmitigated "false" answer to an evaluation statement will lower the SPC of the Building. A "false" evaluation statement may be considered mitigated if the building, element or component is justified using the procedure outlined in the evaluation statement, or the effects of the condition are incorporated in the overall evaluation, as described in Section 2.5.2.2. Alternatively, the SPC rating of a building may be assigned by the Office on the basis of a collapse probability assessment performed in accordance with Section 1.4.5.1.2.
2.5.3.1 Conforming buildings. Conforming buildings, other than those of welded steel moment frame construction (Building Type 3 and possibly Building Types 4 and 6, if a dual system is present), without any unmitigated "false" evaluation statements shall be placed in SPC 5. Other conforming buildings shall be placed in the lowest SPC directed by the evaluation statements.
2.5.3.2 Nonconforming buildings. An unmitigated "False" answer to any evaluation statement shall result in nonconforming buildings being placed in SPC 1, unless directed otherwise by the procedures for that particular evaluation statement. All other nonconforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 2.
2.6 The final report. The report shall include the following elements:
1.
A description of the building, including photographs, and sketches of the lateral-force-resisting system using an OSHPD approved format;

2.
The set ofstatements from the Appendix, with a synopsis of the investigation and supporting calculations that were made;

ARTICLE 3
PROCEDURES FOR BUILDING SYSTEMS


3.0 Introduction. This article sets forth general requirements that apply to all buildings: load path, redundancy, configuration, adjacent buildings and the condition of the materials.
3.1 Load path. The structure contains a complete load path for seismic force effects from any horizontal direction that serves to transfer the inertial forces from the mass to the foundation. For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The load path is the most essential requirement for a building. There must be a lateral-force-resisting system that forms a load path between the foundation and all diaphragm levels and that ties all of the portions of the building together. The load path must be complete and sufficiently strong.
3.2 Redundancy. The structure will remain laterally stable after the failure of any single element.
Check whether stability of the structure depends on a single element. Ifthe failure of a single element (member or connection) will result in loss of lateral stability, the element shall be checked for adequacy using an amplification factor of Ci2, but not less than 1.5. P-delta effects shall be included in this check.
3.3 Configuration. Vertical irregularities are defined in terms of discontinuities of strength, stiffness, geometry and mass.
Horizontal irregularities involve the horizontal distribution oflateral forces to the resisting frames or shear walls. Irregularities in the shape of the diaphragm itself (i.e., diaphragms that are L-shaped or have notches) are covered in Article 7.
3.3.1 Weak story. Visual observation or a Quick Check indicates lhallhere are no significant strength discontinuities in any of the vertical elements in the lateral-force-resisting system; the story strength at any story is not less than 80 percent of the strength of the story above.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check story strengths individually. Where a weak story exists, the resisting elements shall be checked; include P-delta effects and inelastic demand. To compensate for the concentration ofinelastic action where the story strength of the weak story is less than 65 percent of the story above, amplify the design forces in the weak story by the factor cd /2, but not less than 1.5. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
3.3.2 Soft story. Visual observation or a Quick Check indicates that there are no significant stiffness discontinuities in any of the vertical elements in the lateral-force-resisting system; the lateral stiffness of a story is not less than 70 percent of that in the story above or less than 80 percent of the average stiffness of the three stories above.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the stiffness of certain portions of the building. Where a soft story condition is indicated, the stiffness of the building shall be calculated story by story, in order to determine whether a story falls within the definition of a soft story. Where a soft story exists, the resisting elements shall be checked; include P-delta effects. For buildings more than 65 feet or five stories tall, a dynamic analysis shall be performed to compute the distribution of seismic forces.
3.3.3 Geometry. There are no significant geometrical irregularities; there are no setbacks (i.e., no changes in horizontal dimension of the lateral-force-resisting system of more than 30 percent in a story relative to the adjacent stories).
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Where geometric irregularities exist, a dynamic analysis shall be performed to compute the vertical distribution of seismic forces.
3.3.4 Mass. There are no significant mass irregularities; there is no change ofeffective mass of more than 50 percent from one story to the next, excluding light roofs.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the distribution of mass in the building. The effective mass is the real mass consisting of the dead weight of the floor plus the actual weights of partitions and equipment. Where mass irregularities exist, a dynamic analysis shall be performed to compute the vertical distribution of seismic forces.
3.3.5 Vertical discontinuities. All shear walls, infilled walls and frames are continuous to the foundation.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The primary deficiency is in the strength of the columns that support the wall or frame. The secondary deficiency is in the strength of the connecting strut or diaphragm. Conforming buildings which fail these checks shall be placed in SPC4.
Procedure for columns: Check the columns that support the upper verticallateralload-resisting element for their capacity to support the gravity loads plus the overturning forces. The overturning forces shall be based on the design forces amplified by the factor C"/2, but not less than 1.5, or on the capacity of the vertical lateral load-resisting element to resist lateral force if this is greater. The column check shall include P-delta effects.
Procedure for strut or diaphragm: Check the strut or diaphragm for its ability to transfer the load from the discontinuous element to the lower resisting element.
3.3.6 Torsion. The lateral-force-resisting elements form a well-balanced system that is not subject to significant torsion. Significant torsion will be taken as any condition where the distance between the story center ofrigidity and the story center of mass is greater than 20 percent of the width of the structure in either major plan dimension.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. One deficiency is in the layout and the strengths and stiffness of the walls and frames of the lateral-force-resisting system. Another deficiency is in the strength of columns that are not part of the lateral-force-resisting system but are forced to undergo displacements due to the rotation of the diaphragm. Verify the adequacy of the system by analyzing the torsional response using procedures that are appropriate for the relative rigidities of the diaphragms and the vertical resisting elements. Calculate the maximum story drift (the average building drift plus the additional displacement due to torsion). Verify that all vertical load-carrying elements can maintain their load-carrying ability under the expected drifts. When checking columns, include P-delta effects and consider inelastic demand. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC
4.

3.4 Adjacent buildings. There is no immediately adjacent structure that is less than half as tall or has floors/levels that do not match those of the building being evaluated. A neighboring structure is considered to be "immediately adjacent" if it is within 2 inches times the number of stories away from the building being evaluated.
The deficiency is the distance between the buildings. Report the condition as a hazard. Where both buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated. Other conforming buildings which fail these checks shall be placed in SPC 4.
3.5 Deflection incompatibility. Column and beam assemblies that are not part of the lateral-force-resisting system (i.e., gravity load-resisting frames) are capable of accommodating imposed building drifts, including amplified drift caused by diaphragm deflections, without loss of vertical load-carrying capacity.
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the ductility of the vertical load-carrying system. Calculate the expected drifts using the procedures in Section 2.4.4. Use net section properties for all reinforced concrete elements in the lateral-force-resisting system. Include the lateral displacements due to diaphragm deflections, using the diaphragm loading computed in Section 2.4.6. Evaluate the capacity of the nonlateral-force-resisting columns and beam assemblies to undergo the combined drift, considering moment-axial force interaction and column shear.
3.6 Short "captive" columns. There are no columns with height-to-depth ratios less than 75 percent of the nominal height-to-depth ratios of the typical columns at that level.
The deficiency is in the tendency of short captive columns to attract high shear forces because of their high stiffness relative to adjacent elements. Calculate the story drift, and determine the shear demand (Ve) in the short column caused by the drift (Ve =2MIL). The ratio of VJV" shall be less than one, where V~ is the column nominal shear capacity computed in accordance with ACI criteria. Conforming buildings which fail these checks shall be placed in SPC 4.


3.7 Evaluation of materials and conditions.
3.7.1 Deterioration of wood. None of the wood members shows signs of decay, shrinkage, splitting, fire damage or sagging, and none of the metal accessories is deteriorated, broken or loose.
The deficiency is in the capacity of the deteriorated elements. Determine the cause and extent of damage. Identify the lateral-force-resisting system and determine the consequences of the damage to the system. The system shall be judged adequate if it can perform with the damaged elements. Check the structural systems with appropriate reductions in member properties.
3.7.2 Overdriven nails. There is no evidence of overdriven nails in the shear walls or diaphragms.
The deficiency is in the capacity of the fasteners. Check the wall demand and capacity, using reduced strength due to overdriven fasteners.
3.7.3 Deterioration of steel. There is no significant visible rusting, corrosion or other deterioration in any of the steel elements in the vertical-or lateral-force-resisting systems.
The deficiency is the reduction in cross-section of the elements. Check the structural systems with appropriate reductions in member properties. See Article 4 for inspection requirements for welded steel moment-resisting frame structures.

PROCEDURES FOR
MOMENT-RESISTING SYSTEMS


4.0 Introduction. Moment frames develop their resistance to lateral forces through the flexural strength and continuity of beam and column elements. Moment frames may be classified as special, intermediate and ordinary frames.
For evaluations using these regulations, it is not necessary to determine the type of frame in the building. The issues are addressed by appropriate acceptance criteria in the specified procedures. For determination of element capacities, see Article 2, Section 2.4.9.
4.1 Frames with infill walls.
4.1.1 Interfering walls. All infill walls placed in moment frames are isolated from structural elements.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is an inappropriate connection of the wall to the frame. Evaluate the relative strength and stiffness of the walls and frames, considering the nature and size of the joint or connection between the wall and the frame. If the strength of the walls is not commensurate with the stiffness, the building should be treated as Type 7 or Type 10 (Article 2, Section 2.2.3 "Common Building Types"), a frame with infill walls. If the infill walls do not extend the full story height and are not properly isolated from the frame columns, evaluate the column shear demand and capacity, based on a column height equal to the clear distance from the top of the wall to the bottom of the slab or beam above, amplifying the design forces in the short column by Cj2, but not less than 1.5. The shear demand need not exceed the shear capacity conesponding to flexural capacity of the column, based on a column height equal to the clear distance from the top of the wall to the bottom of the slab or beam above.
4.2 Steel moment frames. Welded steel moment frames may be subject to detailed frame joint evaluation requirements, as outlined in this section. The purpose of this joint evaluation is to determine if the building has experienced joint damage in strong ground shaking.
4.2.0.1 Preliminary screening. All welded steel moment frame structures shall undergo a detailed frame joint evaluation if the building is located at a site that has experienced the following:
1.
An earthquake of magnitude greater than or equal to 6.5 that produced ground motion in excess of 0.20 g; or

2.
An earthquake that generated ground motion in excess of


0.30 g.
The ground motion estimates shall be based on actual instrumental recordings in the vicinity of the building. When such ground motion records are not available, ground motion estimates may be based on empirical or analytical techniques. All ground motion estimates shall reflect the site-specific soil conditions.
4.2.0.2 Additional indicators. A detailed frame joint evaluation of the building shall be performed if any of the following apply:
1.
Significant structural damage is observed in one or more welded steel moment frame structures located within 1 km of the building on sites with similar, or more firm, soil properties;

2.
An earthquake having a magnitude of 6.5 or greater, where the structure is located within 5 km of the trace ofa surface rupture or within the vertical projection of the rupture area when no surface rupture has occuned;

3.
Significant architectural or structural damage has been observed in the building following an earthquake; or


4. 	Entry to the building has been limited by the building official because of earthquake damage, regardless of the type or nature of the damage.
4.2.0.3 Connection inspections. Detailed frame joint evaluations shall be performed in accordance with the procedures in the Interim Guidelines: Evaluation, Repair, Modification and Design ofWelded Steel Moment Frame Structures, FEMA 267, August 1995.
4.2.1 Drift check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the frame drift.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check drift using the procedures in Section 2.4.7.1 against the prescribed limit. If the drift exceeds the limiting drift at any story level, the structure shall be evaluated with full-frame analysis using the anticipated distribution of lateral forces to the moment-resisting frames and including P-delta effects. Check the other statements using the demand from this analysis.
4.2.2 Compact members. All moment-frame elements meet the compact section requirements of the basic AISC documents.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the member capacities. Check member capacities, using member demands obtained from a frame analysis. Calculate member capacities using appropriate criteria for noncompact sections. Check the member capacities using appropriate R values (e.g., noncompact members require use of the R value for ordinary frames).
4.2.3 Beam penetrations. All openings in frame-beam webs have a depth less than one-fourth of the beam depth and are located in the center half of the beams.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the shear capacity of the beam. Check that the shear capacity of the beam is sufficient to develop the flexural plastic hinge. Ifthe shear capacity is insufficient to develop the flexural capacity of the member, use the R value for ordinary frames.
4.2.4 Moment connections. All beam-column connections in the lateral-force-resisting moment frame have full-penetration flange welds and a bolted or welded web connection.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the connection. Check the connection on the basis of its strength. Check the member capacities using appropriate R values. Connections that do not develop the flexural capacity of the member require use of the R value for ordinary frames.
4.2.5 Column splices. All column splice details of the moment-resisting frames include connection of both flanges and the web.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the bolts or welds in the connec

tion. Check the adequacy of the splice connection for all gravity and seismic loads. Amplify the seismic load for partial-penetration welded splices by the factor cd /2.
4.2.6 Joint webs. All web thicknesses within joints of moment-resisting frames meet AISC criteria for web shear.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the web. Calculate the joint shear capacity using formulas given in the AISC provisions and compare it to the demand from an equivalent lateral force analysis or the average column shear, Vc, calculated for the Quick Check for drift.
4.2.7 Girder flange continuity plates. There are girder flange continuity plates at joints.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the joint. Check joints without such plates using AISC provisions, using the R value for ordinary frames.
4.2.8 Strong column/weak beam. At least one half of the joints in each story are strong column/weak beam (33 percent on every line of moment frame). Roof joints need not be considered.
The deficiency is excessive ductility demand and displacement in a single story. Compare beam and column moment capacities, including the effect of axial force. The evaluator may consider this condition mitigated if the joints in the building meet the provisions of Section 271 O(g)5 of the 1992 edition of Part 2, Title 24. Conforming buildings which do not meet those provisions shall be placed in SPC 4.
4.2.9 Out-of-plane bracing. Beam-column joints are braced out-of-plane.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the stability of the beam-column joint. Verify the joint bracing by visual observation.
4.2.10 Pre-Northridge earthquake welded moment frame joints. Welded steel moment frame beam-column joints are designed and constructed in accordance with recommendations in FEMA 267, Interim Guidelines: Evaluation, Repair, Modification and Design of Welded Steel Moment Frame Structures, August 1995.
For buildings constructed under permit issued after October 25, 1994, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated. The deficiency is in the ductility of the beam-column joint. The following procedures shall be used for categorizing buildings with welded steel moment frame joints:
Procedure for conforming buildings: Conforming buildings located in Seismic Zone 4 of 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or later version of the CBC, within a zone designated as being potentially subject to near field effects in strong ground shaking, shall be placed in SPC 3.

4.3.3 Prestressed frame elements. The lateral-load-resisting frames do not include any prestressed or post-tensioned elements.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the frames during inelastic straining. Check the capacity of the members and joints using all of the mild steel reinforcing that is available and bonded prestressing when appropriate. The R value used for evaluation shall reflect the ductility and damping of the system. Where better information is not available, multiply the R value selected on the basis of mild reinforcement by 0.75 to account for the effect of prestressing.
4.3.4 Joint eccentricity. There are no eccentricities larger than 20 percent of the smallest column plan dimension between girder and column centerlines.

4.3.5 No shear failures. The shear capacity of frame members is greater than the moment capacity.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is inadequate shear capacity in the columns or beams.

The moment capacity to be compared is the plastic moment, Mp,. The ratio ofthe sum ofthe MP,. for the columns to the sum ofthe Mpr for the beams is required to be not less than 1.2. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 4.
4.3.7 Stirrup and tie hooks. The beam stirrups and column ties are anchored into the member cores with hooks of 135 degrees or more.
The deficiency is in the shear resistance and confinement of the member. Determine if beam stirrups and column ties are appropriately anchored into member cores with hooks of 135 degrees or more. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 4.
4.3.8 Column-tie spacing. Frame columns have ties spaced at d/4 or less throughout their length and at 8 db, or less at all potential plastic hinge regions.

4.3.9 Column-bar splices. All column bar lap splice lengths are greater than 35 db, long and are enclosed by ties spaced at 8 db, or less.
The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the column. Compme the splice length provided with that required by Sections 12.2 and 12.15 of the ACI 318 provisions. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC
4.
4.3.10 Beam bars. At least two longitudinal top and two longitudinal bottom bars extend continuously throughout the length ofeach frame beam. At least 25 percent of the steel provided at the joints for either positive or negative moment is continuous throughout the members.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Determine if the required beam bars are present. For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary.
4.3.11 Beam-bar splices. The lap splices for longitudinal beam reinforcing are located within the center half of the member lengths and not in the vicinity of potential plastic hinges.
The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Determine if the beam bar splices are detailed and located such that the yield capacity of the beam can be developed. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC4.
4.3.12 Stirrup spacing. All beams have stirrups spaced at d/2 or less throughout their length and at 8 db, or less at potential hinge locations.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Determine if the stirrups meet the specified spacing requirements, such that the yield capacity of the beam can be developed.
4.3.13 Beam truss bars. Bent-up longitudinal steel is not used for shear reinforcement.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam.

4.3.14 Joint reinforcing. Column ties extend at their typical spacing through all beam-column joints at exterior columns.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary.

4.3.15 Flat slab frames. The system is not a frame consisting of columns and a flat slab/plate without beams.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Perform a detailed analysis, or assign the building to SPC 1.
4.4 Precast concrete moment frames.
4.4.1 Precast frames. The lateral loads are not resisted by precast concrete frame elements.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Check the adequacy of the precast frames. Where lateral movement will cause strength capacities to be first exceeded at connections, use R = Cd = 1.5 unless there is information on connection behavior that justifies higher values. Where all yielding occurs within members, use the R-value for the appropriate castin-place frame.
4.4.2 Precast connections. For buildings with concrete shear walls, the connection between precast frame elements such as chords, ties and collectors in the lateral-force-resisting system can develop the capacity of the connected members.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Analyze the connections. Determine where connection failures would be brittle (e.g., pull-out of an embedded item would occur before yield of a mild steel element). Analyze structure for stability assuming that these brittle connections have failed or are not capable of transmitting forces, or check such connections for seismic force amplified by factor cd 12, but not less than 1.5. For shear capacity, refer to Section 4.3. For flexure, find the path offorces from the element through the connection into the other element.
4.5 Frames not part of the lateral-force-resisting system. This section deals with frames that were not designed to be part of the lateral-force-resisting system. These are basic structural frames of steel or concrete that are designed for gravity loads with shear walls, bracing or moment frames providing the resistance to lateral forces.
Ifthe primary lateral-force-resisting system consists of concrete walls (infilled in steel frames or monolithic in concrete frames), the building shall be treated as a concrete shear wall building (Type 6) with the frame columns as boundary elements. If the walls are masonry infills, the frames shall be treated as steel or concrete frames with infill walls of masonry (Type 7 or 10). Buildings with steel braces shall be treated as braced frame systems (Type 4). The principal deficiency identified in this section is loss of vertical-load-carrying capacity due to excessive deformations.
The analysis must include the deformations imposed by the infill walls, and the consequences ofthe failure ofsuch walls.

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check the shear walls or braced frames, including the effects of all dead and live loads, and note that the R values for buildings without a complete vertical load-carrying space frame are different from those for complete frame buildings. For wall systems, the frame is considered incomplete ifthe beams end at the edge of a shear wall that has no boundary columns or, if there are such columns, the beams do not continue across in the plane of the wall. For chevron-braced frame systems, the frame is considered incomplete if the beam in the brace frame cannot carry the design dead and live loads without the presence ofthe braces.

PROCEDURES FOR SHEAR WALLS


5.0 Introduction. Shear walls have two aspects: carrying in-plane shear when the earthquake direction under consideration is parallel to the wall and resisting out-of-plane forces when the earthquake direction under consideration is perpendicular to the wall. The in-plane effects are covered in this article. Out-of-plane effects are covered in Article 8. All walls not structurally isolated are assumed to act as shear walls that will participate in resisting lateral forces up to their capacity.
5.1 Concrete shear walls.
5.1.1 Shearing stress check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the shearing stress in the shear walls.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Generate the lateral loads using the Quick Check procedure of Section 2.4.7.3. lfvavg is greater than 50 psi (or square root off)ffc is known), a more detailed evaluation of the structure shall be performed. This evaluation shall employ a more accurate estimation of the level and distribution of the lateral loads, using the analysis procedures in Article 2.
5.1.2 Overturning. All shear walls have hw!lw ratios less than 4 to 1.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the required resistance to overturning moments. Calculate the resistance to the required overturning moments. The overturning resistance shall include the resistance contributed by wall flanges, friction on piling, earth over foundations, and floor and roof weights supported by the wall. The calculated resistance shall be greater than 0.75 times the base moment of the shear wall. The overturning resistance moment may be taken as the righting moment about an edge of the footing or the wall flexural capacity, whichever is less.
5.1.3 Coupling beams. The stirrups in all coupling beams are spaced at d/2 or less and are anchored into the core with hooks of 135 degrees or more.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with lhe 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the coupling beams. Assume that the beams yield. Calculate their end-moment capacity based either on flexural yield or shear capacity, whichever is lower. The coupling beam moment capacity should include the contribution of a reasonable portion of the adjacent floor slab reinforcement when this reinforcement is in tension. Analyze the walls as independent walls with these restoring moments or shears helping to stabilize the walls. Check the stability of the wall and the stresses in the vertical boundaries. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4, and no calculations are necessary.
5.1.4 Column splices. Steel column splice details in shear wall boundary elements can develop the tensile strength of the column.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the splice in the boundary column. Determine the maximum tensile column load in each case and verify the adequacy of the splice to resist this load, including gravity loads. Check the adequacy of the splice connection for all gravity and seismic loads. Amplify the seismic load for partial-penetration welded splices by the factor cd /2, but not less than 1.5, when the seismic load produces tension at the splice.
5.1.5 Wall connections. There is positive connection between the shear walls and the steel beams and columns.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the adequacy of the connections between the shear wall and the beams and columns that are its boundary elements. Calculate the efiective overturning demand for the walls and check the adequacy of the shear transfer to the steel elements. A value for shear friction between steel and concrete shall be included only if the steel element is completely encased with reinforced concrete.
5.1.6 Confinement reinforcing. For shear walls with hw !lw greater than 2.0, the boundary elements are confined with spirals or ties with spacing less then 8db.
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the ductility of the vertical boundary elements that are required to resist large axial forces. Check the need for boundary elements, per ACI 318. Where boundary elements are required but not provided, amplify the seismic forces for the entire structure by the factor 1.25 (and use 0.8Cd for drift calculation). Conforming buildings which fail this evaluation statement shall be placed in SPC 4, and no calculations are necessary.
5.1.7 Reinforcing steel. The total reinforcing steel for concrete walls is greater than 0.0025 times the gross area of the wall along both the longitudinal and transverse axes and the maximum spacing of reinforcing steel is 18 inches.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the quantity of reinforcing in the wall. Calculate the capacity of the walls with the reinforcing that is provided, but amplify the seismic forces by the factor 1.25 (and use 0.8C" for drift calculation). Where the reinforcing in the wall is less than 0.0015 times the gross area of the wall along the longitudinal or transverse axis, or if the reinforcing steel spacing exceeds 18 inches, the contribution of the wall to lateral strength and stiffness of the building shall be ignored and, if it is a bearing wall, the building shall be placed in SPC 1.
5.1.8 Reinforcing at openings. There is special wall reinforcement around all openings.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the reinforcing in the piers and spandrels. Determine the capacity of the spandrels and piers considering all available reinforcing steel that crosses the critical sections.
5.2 Precast concrete shear walls. Shear walls of precast concrete are in segments that are tied together, but the connections may be of a brittle type. Connections adequate for design level forces may not be capable of developing the yield level capacity of the panels. The effects of the precast panel connections on the other evaluation statements concerned with wall elements shall be considered. The deficiency is in the quality and ductility of the connections.
5.2.1 Panel-to-panel connections. Adjacent wall panels are not connected by welded steel inserts.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the inserts. Check the welded inserts. Determine where connection failures would be brittle (e.g., pull-out of an embedded i tern would occur before yield of a mild steel element). Analyze structure for stability assuming that these brittle connections have failed or are not capable of transmitting forces or check such connections for seismic force amplified by the factor Cd/2, but not less than 1.5.
5.2.2 Wall openings. Openings constitute less than 75 percent of the length of any perimeter wall with the wall piers having hw llw ratios of less than 2.0.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency may be in the strength of the panel connections or may be that the reinforced concrete elements actually behave like a moment frame and should be evaluated as such. Check the elements in the precast shear wall system. When large open areas exist, check the transfer ofshear between the diaphragm and the wall. Compare the lateral displacements of the wall due to shear and flexure. Ifmore than 50 percent of the total lateral displacement is due to flexure, or if the width of the wall piers is less than five times the thickness, analyze the wall as a moment frame.
5.2.3 Collectors. Wall elements with openings larger than a typical panel at a building corner are connected to the remainder of the wall with collector reinforcing.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the configuration of the wall or the diaphragm. Find an adequately strong path of forces. If none is found, report this as a deficiency.

If vavg is greater than 15 psi, a more detailed evaluation of the structure shall be performed. This evaluation shall employ a more accurate estimation of the level and distribution of the lateral loads, using the analysis procedures in Article 2.
5.3.2 Reinforcing. The total vertical and horizontal reinforcing steel in reinforced masonry walls is greater than 0.002 times the gross area of the wall with a minimum of0.0007 in either of the two directions, the spacing of reinforcing steel is less than 48 inches and all vertical bars extend to the top of the walls.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Ifthe quantity of wall reinforcing is less than the specified amounts, report this condition as a deficiency.
5.3.3 Reinforcing at openings. All wall openings that interrupt rebar have trim reinforcing on all sides.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary.

The allowable stress (on the gross area) for solid brick masonry is 10 psi; for hollow unit masonry, 6 psi; and for grouted block masonry, 12.5 psi. If vavg is greater than the allowable stress, an Alternative Analysis of the structure shall be performed, or the building shall be placed in SPC 1.

5.4.2 Masonry lay-up.
Filled collar joints of multi wythe masonry walls have negligible voids.
The deficiency is in the lay-up of the wall that left voids between the wythes. Investigate the lay-up. This can be done when masonry units are removed for strength tests. Ifvoids are present, reporl lhis condition as a deficiency.
5.4.3 Proportions. The height/thickness ratio of the wall pan

PROCEDURES FOR BRACED FRAMES

6.0 Introduction. Braced frames develop their resistance to lateral forces by the bracing action of diagonal members. The braces induce forces in the associated beams and columns so that all work together like a truss with all members subjected to stresses that are primarily axial.
A concentrically braced frame has minor eccentricities in the joints of the frame that are accounted for in the design.
An eccentrically braced frame has elements that are strictly controlled to combine a stiffening effect due to the diagonal braces with yielding in the link beams. Eccentrically braced frames are present only in conforming buildings.

7.4.1 Topping slab. Precast concrete diaphragm elements are interconnected by a reinforced concrete topping slab.
The deficiency is in the ability to transfer shear from one element to another. Check the slab element interconnection and check the lateral load capacity of the vertical elements that resist horizontal force. Where the capacity of the diaphragm is less than 150 percent of the sum of the load capacities of the vertical elements and where connections can allow the diaphragm to fail in a brittle manner, the R values used in computing the seismic demand shall be consistent with those for brittle systems (not to exceed R =2). Conforming buildings without a reinforced concrete topping slab shall be placed in SPC 4.

PROCEDURES FOR FOUNDATIONS
AND GEOLOGIC SITE HAZARDS


9.0 Introduction. The seismic evaluation of an existing building shall include an examination of the building foundation, an assessment of the capability of the soil beneath the foundation to withstand the forces applied during an earthquake and an evaluation of any nearby geologic hazards that may affect the stability of the foundation.
9.1 Condition of foundations.
9.1.1 Foundation performance. The structure does not show evidence ofexcessive foundation movement such as settlement or heave that would affect its integrity or strength.
The deficiency is reduction of the integrity and strength of foundation elements by cracking, yielding, tipping or buckling of the foundation. Visually examine lower level walls, partitions, grade beams, visible footings, pile caps and the like for cracking, yielding, buckling and out-of-level conditions. Report evidence of movement as a deficiency.
9.1.2 Deterioration. There is no evidence that foundation elements have deteriorated due to corrosion, sulphate attack, material breakdown or other reasons in a manner that would affect the integrity or strength of the structure.
The deficiency is weakening ofthe foundation due to deterioration, with the same consequences as discussed in Section
9 .1.1. Determine if there is historical evidence in the local area ofdeterioration ofthe particular type offoundation elements in the building where site conditions are similar. Examine the visible foundation elements for evidence of loss of support as specified in Section 9 .1.1.
9.2 Capacity of foundations.
9.2.1 Overturning. The ratio of the effective horizontal dimension, at the foundation level of the seismic-resisting system, to the building height (base/height) exceeds 1.4 Av.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is the concentration of seismic inertial response into narrow elements by the seismic-resisting system, which may overcome the ability of the foundation elements, either structure or soil, to provide adequate resistance. For shallow foundations, evaluate the shear and moment capacity of the foundation elements for adequacy to resist calculated seismic forces. Evaluate the vertical bearing pressure of the soil under seismic loading conditions due to the total gravity and overturning loads and compare to two times the allowable static-bearing pressure. For deep foundations, evaluate the ultimate vertical capacity of the pile or pier under seismic loads. Compare the foundation capacity to the gravity loads plus the overturning loads.
9.2.2 Ties between foundation elements. Foundation ties adequate for seismic forces exist where footings, piles and piers are not restrained by beams, slabs, or competent soils or rock.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is the possibility of significant differential lateral
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
deformations of the foundations. Evaluate the lateral restraint to seismic forces provided by the foundation materials or the structural ties. For shallow foundations, evaluate the horizontal capacity of the foundation soils under seismic loading conditions (the lateral resistance of the footings due to passive resistance on affected sides of the footings plus the friction on the base ofthe footings) and compare to the base shear ofthe building. In the evaluation of base friction, consideration shall be given to the effect ofthe vertical component ofground motion.
9.2.3 Load path at pile caps. The pile caps are capable of transferring overturning and lateral forces between the structure and individual piles in the pile cap.
The deficiency is insufficient capacity of the pile cap to transfer seismic forces from the superstructure to the individual piles. Check the moment and shear capacity to transfer uplift and lateral forces from the point of application on the pile cap to each pile. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
9.2.4 Lateral force on deep foundations. Piles and piers are capable of transferring the lateral forces between the structure and the soil.
The deficiencies include inadequate flexural strength and ductility of piles or piers at the connection to the cap and the upper pmtion of the pile. Compare the maximum lateral resistance of soil against piles or piers and caps against the demand. For concrete piles, check for a minimal amount of longitudinal reinforcement in the upper portion ofpiles or piers and for hoops or ties immediately beneath the caps. Also check for confining transverse reinforcement wherever bending moments might be high, including changes in soil stiffness. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
9.2.5 Pole buildings. Pole foundations have adequate embedment.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is inadequate strength ofthe pole foundation. Check lateral force resistance of embedded poles using conventional procedures, comparing with conventional allowable pressures times 1.5.
9.2.6 Sloping sites. The grade difference from one side of the building to another does not exceed one-half story.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. If this statement is false, include the horizontal force due to the grade difference, appropriately modified for seismic motions, with the seismic inertial force when checking sliding stability and the lateral-force-resisting system below grade.
9.3 Geologic site hazards. This section addresses geologic and local site conditions that can lead to building structural damage and threaten life safety in an earthquake. In the seismic evaluation of buildings for life-safety considerations, it will be necessary to investigate the site to establish that there are no geologic site hazards present or, if they are present, that their threat is not significant or is mitigated by the design. Requirements for engineering geologic reports are given in Section
2.1.2.
9.3.1 Liquefaction. Liquefaction susceptible, saturated, loose granular soils that could jeopardize the building's seismic performance do not exist in the foundation soils at depths within 50 feet under the building.
The deficiency is the potential for liquefaction that will result in vertical settlement and potential loss of foundation support for spread footings, or for lateral spreading ofliquefied soils that can occur on nearly flat slopes and be detrimental to the foundation system. Evaluate the liquefaction potential and consequences of vertical settlement or lateral movement of the foundations. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
9.3.2 Slope failure. The building site is sufficiently remote from potential earthquake-induced slope failures or rockfalls to be unaffected by such failures or is capable of accommodating small predicted movements without failure.
Evaluate the likely movements associated with seismically induced slope failures beneath, above or adjacent to the building and their effect on the structural integrity of the building. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
9.3.3 Surface fault rupture. Surface fault rupture and surface displacement at the building site are not anticipated.
Evaluate the proximity of known active faults to the building. If the potential for surface fault rupture and surface displacement at the building site is present, nonconforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 1. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.

EVALUATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT PART
OF THE LATERAL-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM

10.0 Introduction. This article sets forth general requirements that apply to nonstructural elements related to life-safety issues. Article 11 addresses evaluation of critical nonstructural systems needed for continued hospital function following an earthquake, and assignment of buildings to Nonstructural Performance Categories.
The evaluation statements discussed in this article (and listed in the appendix) deal with life-safety concems. Some of the statements can be answered directly. For others, further investigation will be required in accordance with evaluation procedures indicated in other articles of these regulations using seismic forces indicated in Section 2.4.6 and the appropriate Cc seismic coefficient given in Table 2.4.3.1. Also, the materials used in the nonstructural element and its connections must be considered.
10.1 Nonstructural walls. The term "nonstructural walls" refers to walls that are not part of the load-carrying system, but may become load bearing upon attachment and interaction with other elements. Evaluation must be made to determine if they are capable of resisting seismic forces required by Section
2.4.6 as well as the other requirements of these regulations.
10.1.1 Partitions.
10.1.1.1 Masonry partitions. There are no unbraced unreinforced masonry or hollow clay tile partitions in critical care areas, clinical laboratory service spaces, pharmaceutical service spaces, radiological service spaces, central and sterile supply areas, exit conidors, elevator shafts or stairwells.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check for the presence of support angles at floor and roof, and for spaces at the sides and top of the wall to provide for interaction of the structural system.
10.1.1.2 Structural separations. At structural separations, partitions in exit corridors have seismic or control joints.
Check that seismic and/or control joints have been provided at structural separations. Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
10.1.1.3 Partition bracing. In exit corridors, the tops of partitions that extend only to the ceiling line have lateral bracing.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Partitions extending only to ceilings may overturn or buckle due to the lack of bracing.
10.1.2 Cladding and veneer. For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider these conditions as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Exterior wall panels or cladding can fall iftheir connections to the building frames have insufficient strength and/or ductility.
10.1.2.1 Masonry veneer. Masonry veneer is connected to the back-up with corrosion-resistant ties spaced 24 inches on center maximum with at least one tie for every 22 square feet.
/3

For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check for the presence of the required ties.
10.1.2.2 Cladding panels in moment frame buildings. For moment frame buildings of steel or concrete, panels are isolated from the structural frame to absorb predicted interstory drift without collapse.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check the ability of the cladding panels and their connections to tolerate the story drift computed in Section 2.4.4 without an anchorage failure.
10.1.2.3 Cladding panel connections. Where bearing connections are required, there are at least two bearing connections for each cladding panel and there are at least four connections for each cladding panel capable of resisting out-of-plane forces.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Verify that an adequate number of the appropriate connection types are present for each cladding panel.
10.1.2.4 Cladding panel condition. Cladding panel connections appear to be installed properly. No connection element is severely deteriorated or conoded. There is no cracking in the panel materials indicative of substantial structural distress. There is no substantial damage to exterior cladding due to water leakage. There is no substantial damage to exterior wall cladding due to temperature movements.
Substantial deterioration can lead to loss of cladding elements or panels. Exterior walls shall be checked for deteriora
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

tion. Damage due to corrosion, rotting, freezing or erosion can be concealed within the wall. Probe into the wall space, if necessary, for signs of water leakage at vulnerable interior spaces (e.g., around windows and at floor areas). Check elements that tie cladding to the backup structure and that tie the back-up structure to floor and roof slabs. Check exterior walls for cracking due to thermal movements. Check the cladding systems with appropriate reductions in member capacities. Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
10.1.3 Metal stud back-up systems.
10.1.3.1 General. Additional steel studs frame window and door openings. Corrosion of veneer ties, tie screws, studs and stud tracks is minimal. Stud tracks are adequately fastened to the structural frame.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Verify that adequate framing has been provided around openings in the exterior walls. Check the cladding systems with appropriate reductions in member capacities. Check the adequacy of the connection to the structural frame using the forces specified in Section 2.4.6.
10.1.3.2 Masonry veneer with stud back-up. Masonry veneer more than 30 feet above the ground is supported by shelf angles or other elements at each floor level. Masonry veneer is adequately anchored to the back-up at locations of through-wall flashing. Masonry veneer is connected to the back-up with corrosion-resistant ties spaced 24 inches on center maximum and with at least one tie for every 22 square feet.
/3

For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check that adequate supports and ties are provided.
10.1.4 Masonry veneer with concrete block back-up.
10.1.4.1 General. The concrete block back-up qualifies as reinforced masonry.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Verify that the concrete block back-up meets the requirements of Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3.
10.1.4.2 Masonry veneer support. Masonry veneer more than 30 feet above the ground is supported by shelf angles or other elements at each floor level. Masonry veneer is adequately anchored to the back-up at locations of through-wall flashing. Masonry veneer is connected to the back-up with corrosion-resistant ties spaced 24 inches on center maximum and with at least one tie for every 22 square feet. The concrete block
/3

back-up is positively anchored to the structural frame at 4-foot maximum intervals along the floors and roofs.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check that adequate supports and ties are provided.
10.1.5 Other veneer/panel systems.
10.1.5.1 Thin stone veneer panels. Stone anchorages are adequate for computed loads.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. There
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS
are no visible cracks or weak veins in the stone. Check the adequacy of the connection to the stone anchorage using the forces specified in Section 2.4.6.
10.1.5.2 Wood/aggregate panels. There is no visible deterioration of screws or wood at panel attachment points.
The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Determine the cause and extent of distress and check the attachment ofthe panels with appropriate reductions in capacity. Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4.
10.1.6 Parapets, cornices, ornamentation and appendages. There are no laterally unsupported unreinforced masonry parapets or cornices above the highest anchorage level with height/ thickness ratios greater than 1.5. Concrete parapets with height/thickness ratios greater than 1.5 have vertical reinforcement. Cornices, parapets, signs and other appendages that extend above the highest anchorage level or cantilever from exterior wall faces and other exterior wall ornamentation are reinforced and well anchored to the structural system.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. If any of these items are of insufficient strength and/or are not securely attached to the structural elements, they may break off and fall, becoming significant life-safety hazards. Check the adequacy of these items using the forces specified in Section
2.4.6. The maximum height of an unbraced URM parapet shall be determined based on the height dimension measured above the lower ofeither the level oftension anchors or roof sheathing to the top of the wall parapet. The minimum height of a parapet above the wall anchor should be 12 inches.
Exception: If a reinforced concrete beam is provided at the top of the wall, the minimum height above the wall anchor may be 6 inches.
10.1.7 Means of egress. Canopies are anchored and braced to prevent collapse and blockage of building exits.
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check canopies for the forces specified in Section 2.4.6.

Twenty percent of the anchors (20 minimum) of a given size and type (wedge, shell and sleeve for expansion bolts), at each level of the structure shall be tension tested to three times the maximum calculated design load specified in Section 1630B of 1998 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC but not less than 500 pounds. A minimum of one anchor in any 4-bolt group shall be tested assuming an equal distribution of the calculated force to the bolt group. One-quarter (1/4)-inch diameter anchors need not be tested. Where none of the anchors in the group have calculated tension, testing shall consist of torque testing.
Exception: Internally threaded anchors, such as shell-type anchors, shall be tested to four times the maximum calculated design loads. Attachment hardware shall be shimmed or removed prior to testing so that it does not prevent the possible withdrawal of the anchor.

2. 	Ifan anchor fails the tension test, 20 anchors, installed by the same trade, in the immediate vicinity of the failed anchor shall be tested prior to resuming to a 20 percent sampling rate for testing.
11.3.2 Anchors used in the attachment of equipment and other components. For anchors used in the attachment of equipment and other components listed in the 1995 CBC, Part 2, Title 24, Table 16A-O, the following shall apply:
1. 	A minimum ofone anchor ofa given size shall be tension tested for each piece of equipment or other component under consideration. Where the number of anchors for the piece of equipment or component exceeds four, a minimum of 20 percent of the anchors shall be tension tested. Where none of the anchors in the group have calculated tension, testing shall consist of torque testing.
2.
The tension test load shall be three times the maximum tension force calculated for an anchor in the attachment group using the design loads specified in Section 1630B of 1998 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC or 500 pounds minimum. One-quarter (1/4)-inch diameter anchors need not be tested.

Exception: Internally threaded anchors, such as shell type anchors, shall be tested to four times the maximum calculated design loads. Attachment hardware shall be shimmed or removed prior to testing so that it does not prevent the possible withdrawal of the anchor.

3.
If a single anchor fails, all anchors in the attachment group shall be tested. If two or more anchors fail, the component shall be retrofitted for the forces as for new construction.


11.3.3 Tension testing procedure.
1.
Testing of anchors shall be accomplished by the application of externally applied direct tension force to the anchor. The testing apparatus shall not restrict the probable shear cone failure surface ofthe concrete or masonry.

2.
Torque testing is not permitted in lieu of tension testing unless specifically allowed in these provisions.

3.
A failure is defined when the tension load on the anchor produces a slip of 1/ 8 inch, a shear cone failure in the concrete or masonry, concrete splitting, or fracture of the steel anchor itself prior to attaining the test load value.


Exception: For internally threaded anchors, the allowable slip shall not exceed 1/ 16 inch.
11.3.4 Alternate test criteria. In lieu of testing in accordance with Section 11.3.1 or 11.3.2, a test load may be established by the evaluating engineer. The allowable load that the anchor can resist shall be determined by dividing the test load by the appropriate factors noted in Section 11.3.1 or 11.3.2. No one-third increase is permitted for seismic or wind loads.
11.3.5 Allowable shear loads. Allowable shear loads on anchors shall be determined by either of the following:
1.
Shear values listed in Table 19B-E of 1998 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC, or

2.
Shear values shall be obtained by analysis using Strength Design of Anchorage to Concrete, Section A.6, published by the Portland Cement Association, 1999, with the specified reduction coefficient(s) to convert the "strength" values to allowable stress design values of

APPENDIX H TO CHAPTER 6
HAZUS AEBM REGULATIONS

6-Al HAZUS AEBM technology. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) Multi-Hazard Loss Estimation Technology (HAZUS-MH MR2) and, specifically, the HAZUS Advanced Engineering Building Module (AEBM) are used by the Office with building-specific parameters, described in this appendix, to evaluate the Probability of Collapse of SPC-1 buildings.
6-A2 Probability of collapse. The Probability of Collapse, P[COLl, is calculated by Equation (A6-1):
P[COL]=P[COLjSTR5]XP[STR5] 	(A6-1)
where:
P[COLjSTR5]  =  collapse factor of the HAZUS AEBM, as modified herein, and
P[STR5]  probability of Complete Structural Damage, based on HAZUS AEBM methods and parameters, as modified herein.

6-A3 Building-specific properties. Building-specific properties are based on the building type (structural system), or Model Building Type (MBT), building height (number of stories above seismic base), building age (pre-1933, 1933-1961 or post-1961 design vintage), availability of materials testing data, and Significant Structural Deficiencies.
Table A6-1 lists Significant Structural Deficiencies. Table A6-1 includes older buildings (pre-1933 buildings) and buildings that do not have available materials test data, and treats these conditions as Significant Structural Deficiencies.
SPC-1 buildings with no Significant Structural Deficiencies are evaluated using "Baseline" values of building-specific properties. SPC-1 buildings with one or more Significant Structural Deficiencies are evaluated using Sub-Baseline (SubBase), or Ultra-Sub-Baseline (USB) building-specific properties, as specified in Table A6-1.
Building-specific properties include parameters related to

(1) building capacity, (2) building response, (3) Complete Structural Damage, and (4) building collapse. Appendix H Sections 6-A4 through 6-A7, define the parameters of interest related to building capacity, building response, Complete Structural Damage and building collapse, respectively, and specify appropriate values of these parameters.
6-A4. Building capacity. Building-specific capacity properties of interest include the yield capacity control point (D, A) and the ultimate capacity control point (D,, A), as calculated by Equations (A6-2 through A6-5, respectively):
Ay = 	C, y/a, (A6-2)
T2

Dy = 	9.8 A  (A6-3)
y '

A,  =  AAy  (A6-4)
D,  =  A!l Dy  (A6-5)
where:

C, = 	seismic design coefficient-values of C, are given in Tables A6-2a and A6-2b, respectively,
a, 	modal weight factor, Alpha 1 -values of a, are given in Table A6-4,
T, = elastic period, in seconds -values of T, are given in Table A6-3,
y = 	yield strength factor, Gamma-values of yare given in Table A6-5,
A = 	"overstrength" factor, Lambda-values of Aare given in Table A6-5, and
11 = 	"ductility" factor, Mu -values of 11 are given in Table A6-6.
6-AS Building response. Building-specific response parameters of interest include the elastic damping factor, ~E' and the degradation factor, Kappa. Values of ~E are given in Table A6-7 and values of the Kappa factor are given in Table A6-8.
6-A-6 Complete structural damage. Building-specific damage parameters of interest include the median spectral displacement of the Complete Structural Damage state, SdC' and the associated lognormal standard deviation (Beta) factor, ~c Values of ~c are given in Table A6-11. Median spectral displacement at the Complete Structural Damage state, SdC' is calculated using Equation (A6-6):
sd,C = 	L),c. HR. <X/<X3 (A6-6)
where:
L).c = 	interstory drift ratio (of the story with maximum drift) at the threshold of Complete Structural Damage-values of L).c are given in Table A6-9,
HR = 	height of building at the roof level, in inches -default values of HR are given in Table A6-3 as a function of the number of stories above grade,
<X2 = 	modal height factor, Alpha 2-values of <X2are given in Table A6-4, and
a3 = 	modal shape factor, Alpha 3, relating maximum-story drift and roof drift, values of a 3 are given in Table A6-10.
6-A-7 Building collapse. Building-specific values of the collapse factor, P[COLjSTR5], that describe the fraction of the building likely to be collapsed given that the building has reached the Complete Structural Damage state, STR5, are given in Table A6-12.

Revocation of certification may occur when the Office determines that reasonable grounds exist.
The Office field staff or third parties may propose the suspension/revocation of a certification to the Office based on evidence of a certificate holder's misrepresentation(s), incompetence and/or malfeasance consistent with these regulations. The Office shall investigate the alleged misconduct of the certificate holder, gather evidence related to the incident(s) in question, and interview witnesses, if appropriate. Based upon consideration of the evidence presented, the Office shall determine whether or not reasonable grounds exist for the suspension/revocation of certification.
In the event that the Office determines that reasonable grounds exist for suspension/revocation, the Office will provide the certificate holder in question with an opportunity to participate in a formal interview and/or present additional evidence before a final determination is made. A formal interview may be conducted in person or by telephone. The Office shall make a final determination as to the suspension/revocation after considering all of the evidence on record, including the formal interview and/or any additional information submitted by the certificate holder. Written notification of the Office's final determination will be provided to the certificate holder within 15 days.
(b) Suspension is appropriate when: 1) a certificate holder negligently commits an act amounting to one or more grounds of revocation; 2) a certificate holder acts with negligence/incompetence in the performance of inspection duties; 3) the evidence demonstrates a single or isolated incident rather than a course of negligent/incompetent conduct on the part of the certificate holder in question; and/or 4) the Office determines that other factors, including but not limited to mitigating circumstances or facts relating to the certificate holder's course of conduct, support the suspension of certification in lieu of revocation.
A certification may be suspended for a minimum of one month to a maximum of eighteen months. The duration of suspension will be determined by the Office upon consideration of all of the evidence on record, and account for the severity of the action(s) constituting grounds for suspension.
(c)
Revocation is appropriate when: 1) a certificate holder knowingly or willfully commits an act amounting to one or more grounds for revocation; 2) a certificate holder acts with gross negligence/incompetence in the performance of inspection duties; 3) the evidence demonstrates a history of repeated or continuous deviations from the general standard of care in the inspection industry; and/or 4) the Office determines that other factors, including but not limited to damages to third parties or facts related to the certificate holder's course ofconduct, justify the revocation of the certification.

(d)
Appeal of any suspension or revocation by the certificate holder may be made to the Hospital Building Safety Board pursuant to Article 5 of these regulations, including an expedited appeal as described in Section 7-173.

10-111. Certification and labeling of fenestration product U-factors, solar heat gain coefficients and air leakage. This section establishes rules for implementing labeling and certification requirements relating to U-factors, solar heat gain coef-II ficients (SHGCs), visible transmittance (VT), and air leakage for fenestration products under Section 110.6(a) ofPart 6. This section also provides for designation of the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) as the supervisory entity responsible for administering the state's certification program for fenestration products, provided NFRC meets specified criteria.
(a) Labeling requirements.
1. 	Temporary labels.
A. Every manufactured fenestration product shall have
attached to it a clearly visible temporary label that lists the U-factor, the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT) and that certifies compliance with the air leakage requirements of Section 110.6(a)l. For the Component Modeling Approach (CMA), site-built fenestration products shall have a label certificate that lists the U-factor, the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), and the Visible Transmittance (VT).

B. U-factor, SHGC and VT shall be determined by either:
i. 	Fenestration products rated and certified using NFRC 100, NFRC 200, NFRC 202, NFRC 203

II
or NFRC 400 Rating Procedures. The manufacturer shall stipulate that the ratings were determined in accordance with applicable NFRC procedures. For manufactured fenestration products, a temporary label certificate approved by the supervisory entity (NFRC) meets theII requirements of this section. For component modeling and site-built fenestration products, a label certificate approved by the supervisory entity (NFRC) meets the requirements of this section.
ii. 	For manufactured or site-built fenestration products not rated by NFRC, a temporary label with the words "CEC Default U-factor," followed by the appropriate default U-factor speci

II 	fied in Section 110.6(a)2 and with the words "CEC Default SHGC," followed by the appropriate default SHGC specified in Section 110.6(a)3 and with the words "CEC Default VT," followed by the appropriate VT as specified in Section 110.6(a)4, meets the requirements of this Subsection B.
II
II C. Temporary labels shall also certify that the product complies with the air leakage requirements of Section 110.6(a)l of the Standards.
2. 	Permanent labels. NFRC Rated products shall have a permanent label that is either a stand-alone label, an extension or tab of an existing permanent certification label being used by the manufacturer/responsible party, or series of marks or etchings on the product. The per
II
manent label, coupled with observable product characteristics, can be used to trace the product to certification information on file with the supervisory entity or to a directory of certified products, published by the super

II 	visory entity. For CMA and site-built fenestration products, a label certificate approved by the supervisory entity meets the requirements of this section.
Exception to Section 10-111(a): Field-fabricated fenestration products.

(b) Certification requirements.
1. 	Certification to default ratings. The manufacturer shall certify on the Default Label that the product's U-factor, SHGC and VT meets the default criteria in Sections 110.6(a)2, 110.6(a)3 and 110.6(a)4; and
A. A temporary label, affixed to the product, that meets the requirements of Section 10-lll(a)IB meets this requirement.
B. Ifthe product claims the default U-factor for a thermal break product, the manufacturer shall also certify on the label that the product meets the thermal-break product criteria, specified on the default table, on which the default value is based. Placing the terms "Meets Thermal Break Default Criteria" on the default temporary label or default label certificate meets this requirement.

2. Certification to NFRC Rating Procedure. If a prod-II uct's U-factor, SHGC or VT is based on the NFRC Rating Procedure, the U-factor, SHGC or VT shall be certified by the manufacturer according to the procedures of an independent certifying organization approved by the Commission.
A. A temporary label, affixed to the product or label certificate for CMA and site-built fenestration, II meeting the requirements ofSection 10-lll(a) certified by the independent certifying organization complies with this requirement.
B. An "independent certifying organization approved by the Commission" means any organization authorized by the supervisory entity to certify U-factor ratings, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and Visible
II

Transmittance ratings in accordance with the NFRC Rating Procedure. Ifthe Commission designates the NFRC as the supervisory entity, any independent certification and Inspection Agency (lA) licensed by NFRC shall be deemed to be an "independent certifying organization approved by the Commission."
C. The "supervisory entity" means the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC), except as provided II in Section 10-111 (c) 1.
Exception to Section 10-111(b): Field-fabricated fenestration products.

(c) Designation ofsupervisory entity. The National Fenes
tration Rating Council shall be the supervisory entity to administer the certification program relating to U-factors, SHGC, and VT ratings for fenestration products, provided the Commission determines that the NFRC meets the criteria in Section 10-111(d).
1.
The Commission may consider designating a supervisory entity other than NFRC only if the Commission detem1ines that the NFRC cannot meet the criteria in Section 10-111 (d). Such other supervisory entity shall II meet the criteria in Section 10-111 (d) prior to being designated.

2.
The Commission shall periodically review, at least annually, the structure and operations of the supervisory entity to ensure continuing compliance with the II criteria in Section 10-111 (d).


(d) Criteria for supervisory entity.
1. 	Membership in the entity shall be open on a nondiscriminatory basis to any person or organization that has an interest in uniform thermal performance ratings for fenestration products, including, but not limited to, members of the fenestration industry, glazing infill industry, building industry, design professionals, specifiers, utilities, government agencies and public interest organizations.
