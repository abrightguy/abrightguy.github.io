SECTION 1711
MATERIAL AND TEST STANDARDS


1711.1 Joist hangers. Testing of joist hangers shall be in accordance with Sections 1711.1.1 through 1711.1.3,
as applicable.

1711.1.1 General. The vertical load-bearing capacity, tor�sional moment capacity and deflection characteristics of joist hangers shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D 1761 using lumber having a specific gravity of
0.49 or greater, but not greater than 0.55, as determined in accordance with AF&PA NDS for the joist and headers.
Exception: The joist length shall not be required to exceed 24 inches (610 mm).
1711.1.2 Vertical load capacity for joist hangers. The vertical load-bearing capacity for the joist hanger shall be determined by testing a minimum of three joist hanger assemblies as specified in ASTM D 1761. If the ultimate vertical load for any one of the tests varies more than 20 percent from the average ultimate vertical load, at least three additional tests shall be conducted. The allowable vertical load-bearing of the joist hanger shall be the lowest value determined from the following:
1.
The lowest ultimate vertical load for a single hanger from any test divided by three (where three tests are conducted and each ultimate vertical load does not vary more than 20 percent from the average ultimate vertical load).

2.
The average ultimate vertical load for a single hanger from all tests divided by three (where six or more tests are conducted).

3.
The average from all tests of the vertical loads that produce a vertical movement of the joist with respect to the header of 'Is inch (3.2 mm).

4.
The sum of the allowable design loads for nails or other fasteners utilized to secure the joist hanger to the wood members and allowable bearing loads that contribute to the capacity of the hanger.






5. 	The allowable design load for the wood members forming the connection.
1711.1.2.1 Design value modifications for joist hang�ers. Allowable design values for joist hangers that are determined by Item 4 or 5 in Section 171 1.1.2 shall be permitted to be modified by the appropriate load dura�tion factors as specified in AF&PA NDS but shall not exceed the direct loads as determined by Item 1, 2 or 3 in Section 1711.1.2. Allowable design values deter�mined by Item 1, 2 or 3 in Section 1711.1.2 shall not be modified by load duration factors.
1711.1.3 Torsional moment capacity for joist hangers.
The torsional moment capacity for the joist hanger shall be determined by testing at least three joist hanger assemblies as specified in ASTM D 1761. The allowable torsional moment of the joist hanger shall be the average torsional moment at which the lateral movement of the top or bot�tom of the joist with respect to the original position of the joist is 'Is inch (3.2 mm).
1711.2 Concrete and clay roof tiles. Testing of concrete and clay roof tiles shall be in accordance with Sections 1711.2.1 and 1711.2.2, as applicable.
1711.2.1 Overturning resistance. Concrete and clay roof tiles shall be tested to determine their resistance to over�turning due to wind in accordance with SBCCI SSTD 11 and Chapter 15.
1711.2.2 Wind tunnel testing. Where concrete and clay roof tiles do not satisfy the limitations in Chapter 16 for rigid tile, a wind tunnel test shall be used to determine the wind characteristics of the concrete or clay tile roof cover�ing in accordance with SBCCI SSTD 11 and Chapter 15.
