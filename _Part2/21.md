MINIMUM THICKNESS OF MASONRY WALLS1�2 [DSA-BS/CC]


1.
For walls of varying thickness, 	use the least thickness when determining the height or length to thickness ratio.

2.
In determining the height or length-to-thickness ratio of a cantilevered wall, the dimension to be used shall be twice the dimension of the end of the wall from the lateral support.

3.
Cantilevered walls not part of a building and not carrying applied vertical loads need not meet these minimum requirements but their design must comply with stress and overturning requirements


2114.12 Glass unit masonry construction. Masonry of glass blocks shall be permitted in nonload-bearing exterior or inte�rior walls and shall conform to the requirements of Section 2114.14. Stresses in glass block shall not be utilized. Glass block may be solid or hollow and may contain inserts.
2114.13 Nonbearing walls. All nonbearing masonry walls shall be reinforced as specified in Section 2114.10.1.1. Fences and interior nonbearing nonshear walls may be of hollow-unit masonry construction grouted in cells containing vertical and horizontal reinforcement. Nonbearing walls may be used to carry a superimposed load of not more than 200 pounds per linear foot (2.92 kN/m).
1.
Thickness. Every nonbearing masonry wall shall be so constructed and have a sufficient thickness to withstand all vertical loads and horizontal loads, but in no case shall the thickness of such walls be less than the values set forth in Table 2114.11.1.

Plaster shall not be considered as contributing to the thickness of a wall in computing the height-to-thickness ratio.

2.
Anchorage. All nonbearing walls shall be anchored as required by Section 1604.8.2 and ASCE 7 Chapter 13. Suspended ceilings or other nonstructural elements shall not be used to provide anchorage for masonry walls.


2114.14 Masonry screen walls. Masonry units may be used in nonbearing decorative screen walls. Units may be laid up in panels with units on edge with the open pattern of the unit exposed in the completed wall.

2. 	Mortar joints. Horizontal and vertical joints shall not be less than 114 inch (6 mm) thick. All joints shall be completely filled with mortar and shall be "shoved joint" work. The units of a panel shall be so arranged that either the horizontal or the vertical joint contain�ing reinforcing is continuous without offset. This con�tinuous joint shall be reinforced with a minimum of
0.03 square inch (19 mm2) of reinforcing steel and maximum spacing of 16 in. on center. Reinforcement may be embedded in mortar.
3.
Reinforcement. Joint reinforcement may be composed of two wires made with welded ladder or trussed wire cross ties. In calculating the resisting capacity of the system, compression and tension in the spaced wires may be utilized. Ladder wire reinforcement shall not be spliced and shall be the widest that the mortar joint will accommodate, allowing 112 inch (13 mm) of mortar cover.

4.
Size of panels. The maximum size of panels shall be 144 square feet ( 13.4 m2), with the maximum dimension in either direction of 15 feet (4572 mm). The specified thickness of the units for exterior applications shall not be less than 3718 in.

5.
Panel support. Each panel shall be supported on all edges by a structural member of concrete, masonry or steel. Supports at the top and ends of the panel shall be by means of confinement of the masonry by at least 1 inch (25 mm) into and between the flanges of a steel channel. The space between the end of the panel and the web of the channel shall be filled with resilient material.
