1. ASCE 41 provides acceptance criteria (e.g. m, rotation)for Immediate Occupancy (S1 ), Life Safety (S3 ), and Collapse Prevention (SS), and specifies that values
The required method of interpolation is as follows:

For level S-2, the acceptance value is 113 of the sum of the tabulated value j(1r Immediate Occupancy ( 10 level) and twice the tabulated value for the Life Safety
(LS level).

For level S-4, the acceptance value is one-half the sum of the value .f(Jr the LS level and the value for the Collapse Prevention ( CP) level.
For nonstructural components, N-A corresponds to the IO level, N-C to the LS level, and N-D to the Hazards Reduced (HR level).
For evaluation procedures, N-B shall be the same as for N-A. Where numerical values are used, the values for N-B are one ha/fthe sum of the appropriate IO and
LS values. Where IO or CP values are not given by ASCE 41, then the LS values are permitted to be substituted.
2. Buildings evaluated and retrofitted to meet the requirements for a new building, Chapter 16, Part 2, Title 24, in accordance with the exception irt Section 3419. 1, are deemed to meet the seismic performance requirements of this section.

SECTION 3421 METHOD S


3421.1 The existing or retrofitted structure shall be demon�strated to have the capability to sustain the deformation response due to the specified earthquake ground motions and meet the seismic performance requirements of Section 3417. The registered design professional shall provide an evaluation of the response of the existing structure in its modified configu�ration and condition to the ground motions specified. If the building's seismic performance is evaluated as satisfactory and the peer reviewer( s,) and the enforcement agency concurs, then no further structural modifications of the lat�eral-load-resisting system are required.

When the evaluation indicates the building does not meet the required performance levels given in Table 3417.5 for the risk category, then a retrofit and/or repair design shall be prepared that provides a structure that meets these performance objec�tives and reflects the appropriate consideration of existing con�ditions. Any approach to analysis and design is permitted to be used, provided that the approach shall be rational, shall be consistent with the established principals of mechanics and shall use the known performance characteristics of materials and assemblages under reversing loads typical of severe earth�quake ground motions.
Exception: Further consideration of the structure's seismic performance may be waived by the enforcement agency if both the registered design professional and peer reviewer( s) conclude that the structural system can be expected to per�form at least as well as required by the provisions of this sec�tion without completing an analysis of the structure's compliance with these requirements. A detailed report shall be submitted to the responsible building official that pres�ents the reasons and basis for this conclusion. This report shall be prepared by the registered design professional. The peer reviewer( s) shall concur in this conclusion and affirm to it in writing. The building official shall either approve this decision or require completion of the indicated work speci�fied in this section prior to approval.

2. The enforcement agency may modify or waive the requirementsfor peer review when appropriate.
3421.2.1 The approach used in the development of the design shall be acceptable to the peer reviewer and the enforcement agency and shall be the same method as used in the evaluation of the building. Approaches that are specifi�cally tailored to the type of building, construction materials and specific building characteristics may be used, if they are acceptable to the independent peer reviewer. The use of Method A allowed procedures may also be used under Method B.
3421.2.2 Any method of analysis may be used, subject to acceptance by the peer reviewer( s) and the building official. The general requirements given in ASCE 41, Chapter 2, shall be complied with unless exceptions are accepted by the peer reviewer(s) and building official. Use of other than ASCE 41 procedures in Method B requires building official concurrence before implementation.
3421.2.3 Prior to implementation, the procedures, methods, material assumptions and acceptance/rejection criteria proposed by the registered design professional will be peer reviewed as provided in Section 3422. Where nonlinear pro�cedures are used, prior to any analysis, the representation of the seismic ground motion shall be reviewed and approved by the peer reviewer( s) and the building official.
