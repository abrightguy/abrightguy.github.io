PREFACE 
This document is Part 2.5 of 12 parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the Califor­nia Building Standards Code. This part is known as the California Residential Code. 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legisla­ture, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various state agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building regulations, or standards, have the same force oflaw, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless oth­erwise stipulated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as anno­tated. 



A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effec­tive sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing. 
Should you find publication (e.g., typographical) errors or inconsistencies in this code or wish to offer comments toward improving its format, please address your comments to:

California Matrix Adoption Tables

Format of the California Matrix Adoption Tables 
() 
The matrix adoption tables, examples of which follow, are non-regulatory aids intended to show the user which state agencies have adopted and/or amended given sections of the model code. An agency's statutory authority for certain occupancies or building 
applications determines which chapter or section may be adopted, repealed, amended or added. See Chapter 1, Division I, Sections 
1.2 through 1.14 for agency authority, building applications and enforcement responsibilities. 
The side headings identify the scope of state agencies' adoption as follows: 

0 
Adopt the entire IRC chapter without state amendments. 
If there is an "X" under a particular state agency's acronym on this row; this means that particular state agency has adopted the entire 
model code chapter without any state amendments.

A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public 




DIVISION II ADMINISTRATION 
expense, cause fraud on or victimization of the pub­lic, or conflict with existing local laws or ordi­nances. 
4. 	
A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood haz­ard. 

5. 	
Submission to the applicant of written notice speci­fying the difference between the design flood eleva­tion and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, and stating that con­struction below the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

BUILDING PLANNING 





R301.1.1.1 Alternative provisions for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings. The purpose of this sub­section is to permit alternatives that provide minimum protection of life, limb, health, property, safety and 
.. welfare of the general public and the owners and occu­pants of limited-density owner-built rural dwellings as defined in Chapter 2 of this code. For additional infor­mation see Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Article 8, of Title 25, California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 74. 
To meet compliance with the requirements of this code, provisions ofSection R301.1.1.1, Items 1 though 5 
may be ·utilized for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings when the materials, methods of construction, or appliances are determined appropriate or suitable for their intended purpose by the local enforcing agency. 
1. 	
A limited-density owner-built rural dwelling may be of any type of construction which will provide for a sound structural condition. Structural haz­ards which result in an unsound condition and which may constitute a substandard building are delineated in Section 17920.3 of the Health and 
Safety Code. 


2. 
There shall be no requirements for room dimen­sions as required in Chapter 3, provided there is adequate light and ventilation and means of egress.

3. 	
There shall be no specified requirement for heat­ing capacity or for temperature maintenance. The use of solid-fuel or solar heating devices shall be deemed as complying with the require­
ments of Chapter 3. If nonrenewable fuel is used in these dwellings, rooms so heated shall meet 





· 
current installation standards. 

4. 
Pier foundations, 	stone masonry footings and foundations, pressure-treated lumber, poles or equivalent foundation materials or designs may be used provided that bearing is sufficient. 

5. 
Owner-produced or 	used materials and appli­ances may be utilized unless found not to be of sufficient strength or durability to perform the intended function. Owner-produced or used lum­ber, or shakes and shingles may be utilized unless found to contain dry rot, excessive splitting or other defects obviously rendering the material unfit in strength or durability for the intended purpose.

R301.1.2 Construction systems. The requirements of this code are based on platform and balloon-frame construc­
tion for light-frame buildings. The requirements for con­crete and masonry buildings are based on a balloon framing system. Other framing systems must have equiva­lent detailing to ensure force transfer, continuity and com patible deformations. 
R301.1.3 Engineered design. When a building of other­wise conventional construction contains structural ele­ments exceeding the limits of Section R301 or otherwise 
not conforming to this code, these elements · shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering prac­

tice. The extent of such design need only demonstrate compliance of nonconventional elements with other appli­cable provisions and shall be compatible with the perfor­
mance of the conventional framed system. Engineered design in accordance with the California Building Code is permitted for all buildings and structures, and parts thereof, included in the scope of this code. 



R301.1.3.1 California licensed architect or engineer. 
When any portion of any structure deviates from sub­
stantial compliance with conventional framing require­ments for woodframe construction found in this code, the building official shall require the construction doc­uments to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for that irregular or non­sections of law, the law establishing these provisions is found in Business and Professions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1. 

R301.1.3.2 Woodframe structures greater than two­stories. The building official shall require construction documents to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for all dwellings of woodframe construction more than two stories and basement in height. Notwithstanding other sections of 
law, the law establishing these provisions is found in 


panels prescribed by this code to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer. Notwithstanding other sections of law, the law estab­


lishing these provisions is found in Business and Pro­fessions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1.

R301.2.1 Wind design criteria. Buildings and portions thereof shall be constructed in accordance with the wind provisions of this code using the basic wind speed in Table R301.2(1) as determined from Figure R301.2(4)A. The structural provisions of this code for wind loads are not 
permitted where wind design is required as specified in Section R301.2.1.1. Where different construction meth­ods and structural materials are used for various portions of a building, the applicable requirements of this section for each portion shall apply. Where not otherwise speci­fied, the wind loads listed in Table R301.2(2) adjusted for height and exposure using Table R301 .2(3) shall be used to determine design load performance requirements for wall coverings, curtain walls, roof coverings, exterior win­dows, skylights, garage doors and exterior doors. Asphalt shingles shall be designed for wind speeds in accordance with Section R905.2.4. A continuous load path shall be provided to transmit the applicable uplift forces in Section R802. 11.1 from the roof assembly to the foundation. 
R301.2.1.1 Wind limitations and wind design required. The wind provisions of this code shall not apply to the design of buildings where wind design is required in accordance with Figure R301 .2(4)B or where the basic wind speed from Figure R301.2(4)A equals or exceeds 110 miles per hour (49 m/s). 
Exceptions: 
1. 
For concrete construction, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Sections R404 and R611. 

2. 
For structural insulated panels, the wind provi­sions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Section R6 13. 








In regions where wind design is required in accor­dance with Figure R301.2(4)B or where the basic wind speed shown on Figure R301.2(4)A equals or exceeds 110 miles per hour (49 m/s), the design of buildings for wind loads shall be in accordance with one or more of the following methods: 
1. 
AF&PA 	Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM);or 

2. 
ICC 	Standard for Residential Construction in High-Wind Regions (ICC 600); or 

3. 	
ASCE Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE 7); or 

4. 
AISI Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing­Prescriptive Method For One-and Two-Family Dwellings (AISI S230); or 

5. 	
California Building Code. 



The elements of design not addressed by the meth­ods in Items 1 through 5 shall be in accordance with the provisions of this code. When ASCE 7 or the Califor­nia Building Code is used for the design of the build­ing, the wind speed map and exposure category requirements as specified in ASCE 7 and the California Building Code shall be used. 
R301.2.1.2 Protection of openings. Exterior glazing in buildings located in windbome debris regions shall be protected from windbome debris. Glazed opening pro­tection for windbome debris shall meet the require­ments of the Large Missile Test of ASTM E 1996 and ASTM E 1886 referenced therein. The applicable wind zones for establishing misile types in ASTM E 1996 are shown on Figure R301.2(4)C. Garage door glazed

opening protection for windbome debris shall meet the requirements of an approved impact-resisting standard or ANSI/DASMA 115. 
Exception: Wood structural panels with a minimum thickness of \6 inch (11 mm) and a maximum span of 8 feet (2438 mm) shall be permitted for opening protection in one-and two-story buildings. Panels shall be precut and attached to the framing surround­ing the opening containing the product with the glazed opening. Panels shall be predrilled as required for the anchorage method and shall be secured with the attachment hardware provided. Attachments shall be designed to resist the component and cladding loads determined in accordance with either Table R301.2(2) or ASCE 7, with the permanent corrosion­resistant attachment hardware provided and anchors permanently installed on the building. Attachment in accordance with Table R301.2.1.2 is permitted for buildings with a mean roof height of 33 feet (10 05 8 mm) or less where located in Wind Zones 1 and 2 in accordance with Figure R301.2(4)C.

R301.2.1.3 Wind speed conversion. When referenced documents are based on fastest mile wind speeds, the three-second gust basic wind speeds, V3,, of Figure R301.2( 4) shall be converted to fastest mile wind speeds, Vftn, using Table R301.2.1.3. 

R301.2.1.4 Exposure category. For each wind direc­tion considered, an exposure category that adequately reflects the characteristics of ground surface irregulari­ties shall be determined for the site at which the build­ing or structure is to be constructed. For a site located in the transition zone between categories, the category resulting in the largest wind forces shall apply. Account shall be taken of variations in ground surface roughness that arise from natural topography and vege­tation as well as from constructed features. For a site where multiple detached one-and two-family dwell­ings, townhouses or other structures are to be con­structed as part of a subdivision, master-planned community, or otherwise designated as a developed area by the authority having jurisdiction, the exposure category for an individual structure shall be based upon the site conditions that will exist at the time when all adjacent structures on the site have been con­structed, provided their construction is expected to begin within one year of the start of construction for the structure for which the exposure category is deter­mined. For any given wind direction, the . exposure in which a specific building or other structure is sited shall be assessed as being one of the following catego­ries: 


· 

1. Exposure A. Large city centers with at least 50 

percent of the buildings having a height in excess 
of70 feet (21 336 mm). Use of this exposure cat­
egory shall be limited to those areas for 
. which 
terrain representative of Exposure A prevails in 
the upwind direction for a distance of at least 0.5 
mile (0.8 km) or 10 times the height of the build­
ing or other structure, whichever is greater. Possi­
ble channeling effects or increased velocity 
pressures due to the building or structure being 
located in the wake of adjacent buildings shall be 
taken into account. 


2. 
Exposure B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded 
areas, or other terrain with numerous closely 
spaced obstructions having the size of single­
family dwellings or larger. Exposure B shall be 
assumed unless the site meets the definition of 











C)
another type exposure. 
3, Exposure C. Open terrain with scattered obstruc­
tions, including surface undulations or other 
irregularities, having heights generally less than 
30 feet (9144 mm) extending more than 1,500 
feet ( 45 7 m) from the building site in any quad-

4. 	Exposure D. Flat, unobstructed areas exposed to wind flowing over open water for a distance of at least 1 mile (1.61 km). Shorelines in Exposure D include inland waterways, the Great Lakes, and coastal areas of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. This exposure shall apply only to those buildings and other structures exposed to the wind coming from over the water. Exposure D extends inland from the shoreline a distance of 1500 feet (457 m) or 10 times the height of the building or structure, whichever is greater. 
R301.2.1.5 Topographic wind effects. In areas desig­nated in Table R301.2(1) as having local historical data documenting structural damage to buildings caused by wind speed-up at isolated hills, ridges and escarpments that are abrupt changes from the general topography of the area, topographic wind effects shall be considered in.the design of the building in accordance with Section R301.2.1.5;1 or in accordance with the provisions of ASCE 7. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(1) for topographic features for wind speed-up effect. 
In these designated areas, topographic wind effects 
shall apply only to buildings sited on the top half of an isolated hill, ridge or escarpment where all of the fol­lowing conditions exist: 
1. 	
The average slope of the top half of the hill, ridge or escarpment is 10 percent or greater. 

2. 	
The hill, ridge or escarpment is 60 feet (18 288 mm) or greater in height for Exposure B, 30 feet (9144 mm) or greater in height for Exposure C, and 15 feet (4572 mm) or greater in height for Exposure D. 

3. 	
The hill, ridge or escarpment is isolated or unob­structed by other topographic features of similar height in the upwind direction for a distance mea­sured from its high point of 100 times its height or 2 miles, whichever is less. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(3) for upwind obstruction. 

4. 	
The hill, ridge or escarpment protrudes by a factor of two or more above the height of other upwind topographic features located in any quadrant within a radius of 2 miles measured from its high point.

2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE BUILDING PLANNING 



R301.2.1.5.1 shall be permitted to be used to design 
for wind speed-up effects, where required by Section 
R301.2.1.5. 

Structures located on the top half of isolated hills, ridges or escarpments meeting the conditions of Section R301.2.1.5 shall be designed for an increased basic wind speed as determined by Table R301.2.1.5.1. On the high side of an escarpment, the increased basic wind speed shall extend horizontally downwind from the edge of the escarpment 1.5 times the horizontal length of the upwind slope (1.5L) or 6 times the height of the escarpment (6H), whichever is greater. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(2) for where wind speed increase is applied.

3. 
Where the sprinkler manufacturer specifies dif­ferent criteria for ceiling configurations that are not smooth, flat and horizontal, the required flow rate for that room shall comply with the sprinkler manufacturer's instructions. 

4. 	
The design flow rate for the sprinkler system shall be the flow required by the room with the largest flow rate, based on Items 1, 2 and 3. 

5. 
For the purpose of this section, it shall be permis­sible to reduce the design flow rate for a room by subdividing the space into two or more rooms, where each room is evaluated separately with respect to the required design flow rate. Each room shall be bounded by walls and a ceiling. Openings in walls shall have a lintel not less than 8 inches (203 mm) in depth and each lintel shall form a solid barrier between the ceiling and the top of the opening. 


R313.3.5 Water supply. The water supply shall provide not less than the required design flow rate for sprinklers in accordance with Section R313.3.4.2 at a pressure not less than that used to comply with Section R313.3.6. Where a water supply serves both domestic and fire sprinkler sys­tems, 5 gpm ( 19 Umin) shall be added to the sprinkler sys­tem demand at the point where the systems are connected, to determine the size_ of common piping and the size of the total water supply requirements where no provision is made to prevent flow into the domestic water system upon operation of a sprinkler. 
R313.3.5.1 Water supply from individual sources. 
Where a dwelling unit water supply is from a tank sys­tem, a private well system, a pump, or a combination of these, the available water supply shall be based on the minimum pressure control setting for the pump. 
R313.3.5.2 Required capacity. The water supply shall have the capacity to provide the required design flow rate for sprinklers for a period of time as follows: 
1. 	7 minutes for dwelling units one story in height and less than 2,000 square feet (186 m2) in area. 
For the purpose of determining the area of the dwelling unit, the area of attached garages and attached open carports, porches, balconies and patios shall not be included. 
2. 	10 minutes for dwelling units two or more stories in height or equal to or greater than 2,000 square feet (186 m2) in area. For the purpose of deter­mining the area of the dwelling unit, the area of attached garages and attached open carports, porches, balconies, and patios shall not be included. 
Where a well system, a water supply tank system, a pump, or a combination thereof, is used, the water sup­ply shall serve both domestic and fire sprinkler sys­tems. Any combination of well capacity and tank storage shall be permitted to meet the capacity require­ment.

R313.3.5.3 Connections to automatic fire sprinkler 
systems. The potable water supply to automatic fire 
sprinkler shall be protected against backflow by a dou­
ble check backflow prevention assembly, a double 
check fire protection backflow prevention assembly, a 
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assem­
bly or a reduced pressure principle fire protection 
backflow prevention assembly. 

Exception: Where permitted by Section R313.3.1.1, 
II<

backflow protection for the water supply system shall not be required. 
R313.3.5.3.1 Additives or nonpotable source. 
Where systems contain chemical additives or anti­freeze, or where systems are connected to a nonpo­table secondary water supply, the potable water supply shall be protected against backflow by a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly or a reduced pressure principle fire pro­tection backflow prevention assembly. Where chemi­cal additives or antifreeze is added to only a portion of an automatic fire sprinkler or standpipe system, the reduced pressure principle fire protection back­flow preventer shall be permitted to be located so as to isolate that portion of the system. 
R313.3.6 Pipe sizing. The piping to sprinklers shall be sized for the flow required by Section R313.3.4.2. The flow required to supply the plumbing fixtures shall not be required to be added to the sprinkler design flow. 
R313.3.6.1 Method of sizing pipe. Piping supplying 
sprinklers shall be sized using the prescriptive method 
in Section R313.3.6.2 or by hydraulic calculation in 

accordance with NFPA 13D. The minimum pipe size 
from the water supply source to any sprinkler shall be 
3/4 inch (19 mm) nominal. Threaded adapter fittings at 
the point where sprinklers are attached to the piping 
shall be a minimum of 1/2 inch (13 mm) nominal. 

R313.3.6.2 Prescriptive pipe sizing method. Pipe 
shall be sized by determining the available pressure to 
offset friction loss in piping and identifying a piping 
material, diameter and length using the equation in Sec­
tion R313.3. 6.2. 1 and the procedure in Section 
R313.3.6.2.2. 

R313.3.6.2.1 Available pressure equation. The pressure available to offset friction loss in the inte­rior piping system (P1) shall be determined in accor­dance with the Equation 29-1. 
P1 = Psup-PLsvc-PLm-PLrPL.-Psp 

(Equation 29-1) 
where: 

P1 = Pressure used in applying Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9). 
Psup= Pressure available from the water supply source.

R313.3.6.2.2 Calculation procedure. Determina­tion of the required size for water distribution piping shall be in accordance with the following procedure: 
Step 1 -Determine P,
up 
Obtain the static supply pressure that will be avail­able from the water main from the water purveyor, or for an individual source, the available supply pressure shall be in accordance with Section 
R313.3.5.1. 
Step 2-Determine PL,.c 
Use Table R313.3.6.2(1) to determine the pressure loss in the water service pipe based on the selected size of the water service. 
Step 3 -Determine PLm 
Use Table R313.3.6.2(2) to determine the pressure loss from the water meter, based on the selected water meter size. 
Step 4 -Determine PL4 
Determine the pressure loss from devices other than the water meter installed in the piping system sup­plying sprinklers, such as pressure-reducing valves, backflow preventers, water softeners or water filters. Device pressure losses shall be based on the device manufacturer's specifications. The flow rate used to determine pressure loss shall be the rate from Sec­tion R313.3.4.2, except that 5 gpm (0.3 LIS) shall be added where the device is installed in a water-ser­vice pipe that supplies more than one dwelling. As alternative to deducting pressure loss for a device, an automatic bypass valve shall be installed to divert flow around the device when a sprinkler activates. 
Step 5 -Determine PL, 
Use Table R313.3.6.2(3) to determine the pressure loss associated with changes in elevation. The eleva­tion used in applying the table shall be the difference between the elevation where the water source pres­sure was measured and the elevation of the highest sprinkler. 

Step 6 -Determine P,P 
Determine the maximum pressure required by any individual sprinkler based on the flow rate from Sec­tion R313.3.4.1. The required pressure is provided in the sprinkler manufacturer's published data for the specific sprinkler model based on the selected flow rate. 
Step 7 -Calculate P1 
Using Equation 29-1, calculate the pressure avail­able to offset friction loss in water-distribution pip­ing between the service valve and the sprinklers. 
Step 8 -Determine the maximum allowable pipe length 
Use Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) to select a material and size for water distribution pip­ing. The piping material and size shall be acceptable if the developed length of pipe between the service valve and the most remote sprinkler does not exceed the maximum allowable length specified by the applicable table. Interpolation of Pt between the tab­ular values shall be permitted. 
The maximum allowable length of piping in Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) incor­porates an adjustment for pipe fittings, and no addi­tional consideration of friction losses associated with pipe fittings shall be required. 

R313.3. 7 Instructions and signs. An owner' s manual for the fire sprinkler system shall be provided to the owner. A sign or valve tag shall be installed at the main shutoff valve to the water distribution system stating the follow­ing: "Warning, the water system for this home supplies fire sprinklers that require certain flows and pressures to fight a fire. Devices that restrict the flow or decrease the pressure or automatically shut off the water to the fire sprinkler system, such as water softeners, filtration sys­tems and automatic shutoff valves, shall not be added to this system without a review of the fire sprinkler system by a fire protection specialist. Do not remove this sign." 
R313.3.8 Inspections. The water distribution system shall be inspected in accordance with Sections R313.3.8.1 and R313.3.8.2. 
R313.3.8.1 Preconcealment inspection. The following items shall be verified prior to the concealment of any sprinkler system piping: 
1. 	
Sprinklers are installed in all areas as required by Section R313.3.1.2. 

2. 
Where 	sprinkler water spray patterns are obstructed by construction features, luminaires or ceiling fans, additional sprinklers are installed as required by Section R313.3.2.4.2. 

3. 	
Sprinklers are the correct temperature rating and are installed at or beyond the required separation distances from heat sources as required by Sec­tions R313.3.2.1 and R313.3.2.2. 

4. 
The pipe size equals or exceeds the size used in applying Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) or, if the piping system was hydraulically calculated in accordance with Sec­tion R313.3.6.1, the size used in the hydraulic calculation.

R314.6 Existing Group R-3 occupancies. 

R314.6.1 Existing buildings housing Group R-3 occupan­cies established prior to the effective date of these regula­tions may have their use continued if they conform or are made to conform to provisions of these regulations to the extent that reasonable and adequate life safety against the hazards of fire, panic and explosion is substantially pro­vided. Additional means of egress, the installation of auto­matic sprinkler systems, automatic fire alarm system or 




BUILDING PLANNING 



other life safety measures, may be required to provide rea­sonable and adequate safety. 

Note: It is the intent of this section that every existing occupancy need not mandatorily conform with the requirements for new construction. Reasonable judg­ment in the application of requirements must be exer­cised by the enforcing agency. 
R314.6.2 For purposes of clarification, Health and Safety Code Section 13113.7 is repeated. 
a. 	Except as otherwise provided in this section, a smoke detector, approved and listed by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to Section 13114, shall be installed, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions in each dwelling intended for human occupancy within the earliest applicable time period as follows: 
1. For all dwelling units intended for human occu­pancy, upon the owner's application on or after January 1, 1985, for a permit for alterations, repairs, or additions, exceeding one thousand
· 
dollars ($1,000). 
2. For all other dwelling units intended for human occupancy on or after January 1, 1987. 
However, if any local rule, regulation, or ordinance, adopted prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) requires installation in a dwelling unit intended for human occupancy of smoke detector, which receive their power from the electrical system of the building and requires compliance with the local rule, reg­ulation, or ordinance at a date subsequent to the dates specified in this section, the compliance date specified in the rule, regulation, or ordi­nance shall, but only with respect to the dwelling units specified in this section, take precedence over the dates specified in this section. 
The State Fire Marshal may adopt regula­tions exempting dwellings intended for human occupancy with fire sprinkler systems from the provisions of this section, if he or she determines that a smoke detector is not reasonably necessary for fire safety in the occupancy. 
Unless prohibited by local rules, regulations, or ordinances, a battery-operated smoke detector which otherwise meets the standards adopted pursuant to Section 13114 for smoke detectors, satisfies the requirements of this section. 
b. 	"Dwelling units intended for human occupancy, " as used in this section, includes a duplex, lodging house, apartment complex, hotel, motel, condomin­ium, stock cooperative, time-share project, or dwell­ing unit of a multiple-unit dwelling complex. For the purpose of this part, "dwelling units intended for human occupancy " does not include manufactured homes as defined in Section 18007, mobile homes as defined in Section 18008, and commercial coaches as defined in Section 18001.8. 

c. 	The owner of each dwelling unit subject to this sec­
tion shall supply and install smoke detectors 
required by this section in the locations and in the 
manner set forth in the manufacturer's instructions, 
as approved by the State Fire Marshal's regulations. 
In the case of apartment complexes and other multi­
ple-dwelling complexes, a smoke detector shall be 
installed in the common stairwells. All fire alarm 
warning systems supplemental to the smoke detector 



0 
shall also be listed by the State Fire Marshal. 
d. A high-rise structure, as defined in subdivision (b) of 
Section 13210 and regulated by Chapter 3 (com­
mencing with Section 13210), and which is used for 
purposes other than as dwelling units intended for 
human occupancy, is exempt from the requirements 

0 
of this section. 
e. 	The owner shall be responsible for testing and main­
taining detectors in hotels, motels, lodging houses, 
and common stairwells of apartment complexes and 
other multiple-dwelling complexes. 

An owner or the owner's agent may enter any dwelling unit, efficiency dwelling unit, guest room, and suite owned by the owner for the purpose of installing, repairing, testing, and maintaining single station smoke detectors required by this section. Except in cases of emergency, the owner or owner's agent shall give the tenants of each such unit, room, or suite reasonable notice in writing of the intention to enter and shall enter only during normal business hours. Twenty-four hours shall be presumed to be rea­sonable notice in absence of evidence to the contrary. 

The smoke detector shall be operable at the time that the tenant takes possession. The apartment complex tenant shall be responsible for notifying the manager or owner if the tenant becomes aware of an inoperable smoke detector within his or her unit. The owner or authorized agent shall correct any reported deficiencies in the smoke detector and shall not be in violation of this section for a deficient smoke detector when he or she has not received notice of the deficiency. 
f. 	
A violation of this section is an infraction punish­
able by a maximum fine of two hundred dollars 
($200) for each offense. 


g. 
This section shall not affect any rights which the 
parties may have under any other provision of law 
because of the presence or absence of a smoke 
detector. 


h. 	
This section shall not apply to the installation of 
smoke detectors in single1amily dwellings or fac­
tory-built housing which is regulated by Section 
13113.8, as added by Assembly Bill No. 2285 of the

R504.1 General. Pressure preservatively treated-wood base­ment floors and floors on ground shall be designed to with­stand axial forces and bending moments resulting from lateral soil pressures at the base of the exterior walls and floor live and dead loads. Floor framing shall be designed to meet joist deflection requirements in accordance with Section R301. 


R504.1.1 Unbalanced soil loads. Unless special provision 
is made to resist sliding caused by unbalanced lateral soil 
loads, wood basement floors shall be limited to applica­
tions where the differential depth of fill on opposite exte­
rior foundation walls is 2 feet (610 mm) or less. 



R504.1.2 Construction. Joists in wood basement floors 
shall bear tightly against the narrow face of studs in the 
foundation wall or directly against a band joist that bears 
on the studs. Plywood subfloor shall be continuous over 
lapped joists or over butt joints between in-line joists. Suf­
ficient blocking shall be provided between joists to trans­

R603.9.1 Sheathing materials. Structural sheathing pan­els shall consist of minimum 7/16-inch-thick (11 mm) ori­ented strand board or 15/32-inch-thick (12 mm) plywood. 
R603.9.2 Determination of minimum length of full height sheathing. The minimum length of full height sheathing on each braced wall line shall be determined by multiplying the length of the braced wall line by the per­centage obtained from Table R603.9.2(1) and by the plan aspect-ratio adjustment factors obtained from Table R603.9.2(2). The minimum length of full height sheathing shall not be less than 20 percent of the braced wall line length. 
To be considered full height sheathing, structural sheathing shall extend from the bottom to the top of the wall without interruption by openings. Only sheathed, full height wall sections, uninterrupted by openings, which are a minimum of 48 inches (1219 mm) wide, shall be counted toward meeting the minimum percentages in Table R603.9.2(1). In addition, structural sheathing shall comply with all of the following requirements: 
31 1 WALL CONSTRUCTION 

1. 
Be installed with the long dimension parallel to the stud framing (i.e., vertical orientation) and shall cover the full vertical height of wall from the bottom of the bottom track to the top of the top track of each story. Installing the long dimension perpendicular to the stud framing or using shorter segments shall be permitted provided that the horizontal joint is blocked as described in Item 2. 

2. 
Be blocked when the long dimension is installed perpendicular to the stud framing (i.e., horizontal orientation). Blocking shall be a minimum of 33 mil 


(0.84 mm) thickness. Each horizontal structural sheathing panel shall be fastened with No. 8 screws spaced at 6 inches (152 mm) on center to the block­ing at the joint. 
3. Be applied to each end (comers) of each of the exte­rior walls with a minimum 48-inch-wide (1219 mm) panel. 
R603.9.2.1 Full height sheathing. The minimum per­centage of full-height structural sheathing shall be mul­tiplied by 1.10 for 9-foot-high (2743 mm) walls and multiplied by 1.20 for 10-foot-high (3048 mm) walls. 
R603.9.2.2 Full height sheathing in hip roof homes. 
For hip roofed homes, the minimum percentages of full 
height sheathing in Table R603.9.2(1), based upon 
wind, shall be permitted to be multiplied by a factor of 
0.95 for roof slopes not exceeding 7:12 and a factor of 
0.9 for roof slopes greater than 7:12. 
R603.9.2.3 Full height sheathing in lowest story. In the lowest story of a dwelling, multiplying the percent­age of full height sheathing required in Table R603.9.2(1) by 0.6, shall be permitted provided hold down anchors are provided in accordance with Section R603.9.4.2.

R611. 7 Solid walls for resistance to lateral forces. 
R611.7.1 Length of solid wall. Each exterior wall line in each story shall have a total length of solid wall required by Section R6 11.7.1.1. A solid wall is a section of flat, waffle-grid or screen-grid wall, extending the full story height without openings or penetrations, except those per­mitted by Section R611.7.2. Solid wall segments that con­tribute to the total length of solid wall shall comply with Section R611.7.2. 
R611.7.1.1 Length of solid wall for wind. All build­ings shall have solid walls in each exterior endwall line (the side of a building that is parallel to the span of the roof or floor framing) and sidewall line (the side of a building that is perpendicular to the span of the roof or floor framing) to resist lateral in-plane wind forces. The site-appropriate basic wind speed and exposure cate­gory shall be used in Tables R611.7(1A) through (I C) to determine the unreduced total length, UR, of solid wall required in each exterior endwall line and sidewall line. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet (10 668 mm), the unreduced values determined from Tables R611.7(1A) though (lC) is permitted by multiplying by the applicable factor, R1, from Table R611.7(2); however, reduced values shall not be less than the minimum values in Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC). Where the floor-to-ceiling height of a story is less than 10 feet (3048 mm), the unreduced val­ues determined from Tables R611.7(1A) through (C), including minimum values, is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R2, from Table R611.7(3). To account for different design strengths than assumed in determining the values in Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC), the unreduced lengths deter­mined from Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC), includ­ing minimum values, are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R3, from Table R611.7(4). The reductions permitted by Tables R611.7(2), R611.7(3) and R611.7(4) are cumulative. 
The total length of solid wall segments, TL, in a wall line that comply with the minimum length requirements of Section R611.7.2.1 [see Figure R611.7(1)] shall be equal to or greater than the product of the unreduced length of solid wall from Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC), UR and the applicable reduction factors, if any, from Tables R611.7(2), R611.7(3) and R611.7(4) as indicated by Equation R6-l.

R3 
Table R611.7(4), and 

UR = Unreduced length of solid wall from Tables 
R611.7(1A) through (lC). 

The total length of solid wall in a wall line, TL, shall 
not be less than that provided by two solid wall seg­
ments complying with the minimum length require­
ments of Section R611.7.2.1. 


To facilitate determining the required wall thickness, 
wall type, number and grade of vertical bars at the each 
end of each solid wall segment, and whether shear rein­
forcement is required, use of Equation R6-2 is permitted.

lated. 



R611.7.2 Solid wall segments. Solid wall segments that contribute to the required length of solid wall shall comply with this section. Reinforcement shall be provided in accordance with Section R611.7.2.2 and Table R611.7(4). Solid wall segments shall extend the full story-height without openings, other than openings for the utilities and other building services passing through the wall. In flat walls and waffle-grid walls, such openings shall have an area of less than 30 square inches (19 355 mm2) with no 
0

dimension exceeding 61/4 inches (159 mm), 
and shall not be located within 6 inches (152 mm) of the side edges of the solid wall segment. In screen-grid walls, such openings shall be located in the portion of the solid wall segment 
between horizontal and vertical cores of concrete and opening size and location are not restricted provided no concrete is removed. 

R611.7.2.1 Minimum length of solid wall segment and maximum spacing. Only solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length shall be included in the total length of solid wall required by Section R611. 7 .1. In addition, no more than two solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length and less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in length shall be included in the required ()total length of solid wall. The maximum clear opening width shall be 18 feet (5486 mm). See Figure R611.7(1).

used, shall be located at each end of each solid wall segment in accordance with the applicable detail in Figure R611.7(2). The No. 4 vertical bar required on each side of an opening by Section R611.8.1.2 is permitted to be used as reinforcement at the ends of solid wall segments where installed in accordance 
with the applicable detail in Figure R611.7(2). There shall be not less than two No. 4 bars at each end of solid wall segments located as required by the appli­cable detail in Figure R611.7(2). One of the bars at each end of solid wall segments shall be deemed to meet the requirements for vertical wall reinforce­ment required by Section R611.6.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 mile per hour= 0.447 rnls, 1 pound-force per linear foot= 0.146 kN/m, 1 pound per square foot= 47.88 Pa. 
a. 
Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 6-10 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet. For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each endwall [Table R611.7(1A) or R611. 7(1B) or sidewall (Table R611. 7(1 C)], as appropriate. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the required solid wall length. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building. 

b. 
Tabulated lengths in the "minimum" coluum are based on the requirement of Section 6. 1.4. 1 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum service level force of 10 psf multiplied by the area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the "minimum" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R611.7.1.1. 

c. 
For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R, from 


1

Table R611.7(2). The reduced length shall not be less than the "minimum" value shown in the table. 
d. 
Tabulated lengths for "one story or top story of two story" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for "first story of two story" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in Table R611.7(1A), (lB) or (lC), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R611.7(3). 

e. 
Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R611.7(4).

a. 	
Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 6-10 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet. For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each endwall [Table R611.7(1A) or R611.7(1B)] or sidewall [Table R611.7(1C)], as appropriate. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the required solid wall length. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building. 

b. 
Tabulated lengths in the "minimum" colunm are based on the requirement of Section 6.1.4.1 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum service level force of 10 psf multiplied by the area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the "minimum" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R611. 7.I. I. 

c. 	
For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R611.7(2). The reduced length shall not be less than the "minimum" value shown in the table. 

d. 
Tabulated lengths for "one story or top story of two story" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for "first story of two story" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the fust and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in Table R611.7(1A), (lB) or (!C), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R611.7(3). 

e. 	
Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R611.7(4). 

f. 
The reduction factors, R1,  and R3, in Tables R611.7(2), R611.7(3), and R611.7(4), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid walls segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R611.7.1 and R611.7.2.1, respectively.

a. 
Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 6-10 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet. For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each endwall [Table R611.7(1A) or R611.7(1B)] or sidewall [(Table R611.7(1C)], as appropriate. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the required solid wall length. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building. 

b. 
Tabulated lengths in the "minimum" column are based on the requirement of Section 6.1.4.1 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum service level force of 10 psf multiplied by the area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the "miuimum" value. Where the miuimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R611.7 .1.1. 

c. 
For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R1, from Table R611.7(2). The reduced length shall not be less than the "miuimum" value shown in the table. 

d. 
Tabulated lengths for "one story or top story of two story" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for ''first story of two story" are

R611.8.2.1 Lintels designed for gravity load-bearing conditions. Where a lintel will be subjected to gravity load condition 1 through 5 of Table R611.8(1), the clear span of the lintel shall not exceed that permitted by Tables R611.8(2) through R611.8(8). The maximum clear span of lintels with and without stirrups in flat walls shall be determined in accordance with Tables R611.8(2) through R611.8(5), and constructed in accor­dance with Figure R611.8(2). The maximum clear span of lintels with and without stirrups in waffle-grid walls shall be determined in accordance with Tables R611.8(6) and R611.8(7), and constructed in accor­dance with Figure R611.8(3). The maximum clear span of lintels with and without stirrups in screen-grid walls shall be determined in accordance with Table R611.8(8), and constructed in accordance with Figure R611.8(4). 
Where required by the applicable table, No. 3 stir­rups shall be installed in lintels at a maximum spacing of d/2 where d equals the depth of the lintel, D, less the cover of the concrete as shown in Figures R611.8(2) through R611.8(4). The smaller value of d computed for the top and bottom bar shall be used to determine the maximum stirrup spacing. Where stirrups are required in a lintel with a single bar or two bundled bars in the top and bottom, they shall be fabricated like the letter ."c" or "s". with 135-degree (2.36 rad) standard 
hooks at each end that comply with Section R611.5.4.5 and Figure R611.5.4(3) and installed as shown in Fig­ures R611.8(2) through R611.8(4). Where two bars are required in the top and bottom of the lintel and the bars are not bundled, the bars shall be separated by a mini­mum of 1 inch (25 mm). The free end of the stirrups shall be fabricated with 90-or 135-degree (1.57 or 2.36 rad) standard hooks that comply with Section R611.5.4.5 and Figure R611.5.4(3) and installed as shown in Figures R611.8(2) and R611.8(3). For flat, waffle-grid and screen-grid lintels, stirrups are not required in the center distance, A, portion of spans in accordance with Figure R611.8(1) and Tables R611.8(2) through R611.8(8). See Section R611.8.2.2, Item 5, for requirement for stirrups through out lintels with bundled bars.

SIZING AND CAPACITIES OF GAS PIPING 
(This appendix is informative and is not part of the code. This appendix is an excerpt from the 2012 International Fuel Gas Code, coordinated with the section numbering of the International Residential Code.) 
II 




A.l General piping considerations. The first goal of deter­mining the pipe sizing for a fuel gas piping system is to make sure that there is sufficient gas pressure at the inlet to each appliance. The majority of systems are residential and the appliances will all have the same, or nearly the same, require­ment for minimum gas pressure at the appliance inlet. This pressure will be about 5-inch water column (w.c.) (1.25 kPa), which is enough for proper operation of the appliance regula­tor to deliver about 3.5-inches water column (w.c.) (875 kPa) to the burner itself. The pressure drop in the piping is sub­tracted from the source delivery pressure to verify that the minimum is available at the appliance. 
There are other systems, however, where the required inlet pressure to the different appliances may be quite varied. In such cases, the greatest inlet pressure required must be satis­fied, as well as the farthest appliance, which is almost always the critical appliance in small systems. 
There is an additional requirement to be observed besides the capacity of the system at 100-percent flow. That require­ment is that at minimum flow, the pressure at the inlet to any appliance does not exceed the pressure rating of the appliance regulator. This would seldom be of concern in small systems if the source pressure is 1/2 psi (14-inch w.c.) (3.5 kPa) or less but it should be verified for systems with greater gas pressure at the point of supply. 
To determine the size of piping used in a gas piping sys­tem, the following factors must be considered: 
(1) Allowable loss in pressure from point of delivery to appliance. 
2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE 
(2) 
Maximum gas demand. 

(3) 
Length of piping and number of fittings. 

(4) 
Specific gravity of the gas. 

(5) 
Diversity factor. 



For any gas piping system, or special appliance, or for con­ditions other than those covered by the tables provided in this code, such as longer runs, greater gas demands or greater pressure drops, the size of each gas piping system should be determined by standard engineering practices acceptable to the code official. 
A.2 Description of tables. 

A.2.1 General. The quantity of gas to be provided at each outlet should be determined, whenever possible, directly from the manufacturer's gas input Btulh rating of the appli­ance that will be installed. In case the ratings of the appli­ances to be installed are not known, Table 402.2 shows the approximate consumption (in Btu per hour) of certain types of typical household appliances. 
To obtain the cubic feet per hour of gas required, divide the total Btulh input of all appliances by the average Btu heating value per cubic feet of the gas. The average Btu per cubic feet of the gas in the area of the installation can be obtained from the serving gas supplier. 
A.2.2 Low pressure natural gas tables. Capacities for gas at low pressure [less than 2.0 psig (13.8 kPa gauge)] in cubic feet per hour of 0.60 specific gravity gas for different sizes and lengths are shown in Tables 402.4(1) and 402.4(2) for 

APPENDIX A 
iron pipe or equivalent rigid pipe; in Tables 402.4(8) through and Table 402.4(36) for polyethylene plastic pipe are based 402.4(11) for smooth wall semirigid tubing; and in Tables on operating pressures greater than 1 1/2 pounds per square 
(continued) 
402.4(15) through 402.4(17) for corrugated stainless steel tubing. Tables 402.4(1) and 402.4(6) are based upon a pres­sure drop of 0.3-inch w.c. (75 Pa), whereas Tables 402.4(2), 402.4(9) and 402.4(15) are based upon a pressure drop of 0.5­inch w.c. (125 Pa). Tables 402.4(3), 402.4(4), 402.4(10), 402.4(11), 402.4(16) and 402.4(17) are special low-pressure applications based upon pressure drops greater than 0.5-inch 
inch (psi) (3.5 kPa) and pressure drops greater than 0.5-inch 
w.c. (125 Pa). In using these tables, an allowance (in equiva­lent length of pipe) should be considered for any piping run with four or more fittings [see Table A.2.2]. 
A.2.4 Natural gas specific gravity. Gas piping systems that are to be supplied with gas of a specific gravity of 0. 70 or less

A.2.5 Higher pressure natural gas tables. Capacities for gas at pressures 2.0 psig (13.8 kPa) or greater in cubic feet per hour of 0.60 specific gravity gas for different sizes and lengths are shown in Tables 402.4(5) through 402.4(7) for iron pipe or equivalent rigid pipe; Tables 402.4(12) to 402.4(14) for semirigid tubing; Tables 402.4(18) and 402.4(19) for corrugated stainless steel tubing; and Table 402.4(22) for polyethylene plastic pipe. 
A.3 Use of capacity tables. 
A.3.1 Longest length method. This sizing method is conser­vative in its approach by applying the maximum operating conditions in the system as the norm for the system and by setting the length of pipe used to size any given part of the piping system to the maximum value. 
To determine the size of each section of gas piping in a system within the range of the capacity tables, proceed as fol­lows (also see sample calculations included in this Appen­dix): 
(1) 	
Divide the piping system into appropriate segments consistent with the presence of tees, branch lines and main runs. For each segment, determine the gas load (assuming all appliances operate simultaneously) and its overall length. An allowance (in equivalent length of pipe) as determined from Table A.2.2 shall be considered for piping segments that include four or more fittings. 

(2) 
Determine the gas demand of each appliance to be attached to the piping system. Where Tables 402.4(1) through 402.4(24) are to be used to select the piping size, calculate the gas demand in terms of cubic feet per hour for each piping system outlet. Where Tables 402.4(25) through 402.4(37) are to be used to select the piping size, calculate the gas demand in terms of 




thousands of Btu per hour for each piping system outlet. 


(3) 	
Where the piping system is for use with other than 
undiluted liquefied petroleum gases, determine the 
design system pressure, the allowable loss in pressure 
(pressure drop), and specific gravity of the gas to be 
used in the piping system. 


(4) 
Determine the length of piping from the point of 
delivery to the most remote outlet in the building/ 
piping system. 


(5) 	
In the appropriate capacity table, select the row 
showing the measured length or the next longer length 
if the table does not give the exact length. This is the 



0
0 
only length used in determining the size of any section of gas piping Ifthe gravity factor is to be applied, the values in the selected row of the table are multiplied by the appropriate multiplier from Table A.2.4. 

(6) 
Use this horizontal row to locate ALL gas demand 
figures for this particular system of piping. 


(7) 
Starting at the most remote outlet, find the gas demand 
for that outlet in the horizontal row just selected. If the 
exact figure of demand is not shown, choose the next 
larger figure left in the row. 


(8) 
Opposite this demand figure, in the first row 	at the 
top, the correct size of gas piping will be found. 


(9) 	
Proceed in a similar manner for each outlet and each 
section of gas piping. For each section of piping, 
determine the total gas demand supplied by that 
section. 





When a large number of piping components (such as elbows, tees and valves) are installed in a pipe run, additional pressure loss can be accounted for by the use of equivalent lengths. Pressure loss across any piping component can be equated to the pressure drop through a length of pipe. The equivalent length of a combination of only four elbows/tees can result in a jump to the next larger length row, resulting in a significant reduction in capacity. The equivalent lengths in feet shown in Table A.2.2 have been computed on a basis that the inside diameter corresponds to that of Schedule 40 (stan­
0

dard-weight) steel pipe, which is close enough for most pur­poses involving other schedules of pipe. Where a more specific solution for equivalent length is desired, this may be made by multiplying the actual inside diameter of the pipe in inches by n/12, or the actual inside diameter in feet by n (n can be read from the table heading). The equivalent length values can be used with reasonable accuracy for copper or brass fittings and bends although the resistance per foot of copper or brass pipe is less than that of steel. For copper or brass valves, however, the equivalent length of pipe should be taken as 45 percent longer than the values in the table, which are for steel pipe.

0 A.3.2 Branch length method. This sizing method reduces 
0 
the amount of conservatism built into the traditional Longest Length Method. The longest length as measured from the meter to the furthest remote appliance is only used to size the initial parts of the overall piping system. The Branch Length Method is applied in the following manner: 
(1) Determine the gas load for each of the connected appliances. 
0 
(2) Starting from the meter, divide the piping system into a number of connected segments, and determine the length and amount of gas that each segment would carry assuming that all appliances were operated simultaneously. An allowance (in equivalent length of 
pipe) as determined from Table A.2.2 should be considered for piping segments that include four or 
more fittings. 
(3) 
Determine the distance from the outlet of the gas meter to the appliance furthest removed from the meter. 

(4) 
Using the longest distance (found in Step 3), size each piping segment from the meter to the most remote appliance outlet. 


0 
(5) 
For each of these piping segments, use the longest length and the calculated gas load for all of the connected appliances for the segment and begin the sizing process in Steps 6 through 8. 

(6) Referring 	to the appropriate sizing table (based on operating conditions and piping material), find the longest length distance in the first column or the next larger distance if the exact distance is not listed. The use of alternative operating pressures and/or pressure drops will require the use of a different sizing table, but will not alter the sizing methodology. In many cases, the use of alternative operating pressures and/or pressure drops will require the approval of both the code official and the local gas serving utility. 

0 
(7) 
Trace across this row until the gas load is found or the closest larger capacity if the exact capacity is not listed. 

(8) 
Read up the table column and select the appropriate pipe size in the top row. Repeat Steps 6, 7 and 8 for each pipe segment in the longest run. 

(9) 	
Size each remaining section of branch piping not previously sized by measuring the distance from the gas meter location to the most remote outlet in that branch, using the gas load of attached appliances and following the procedures of Steps 2 through 8. 




A.3.3 Hybrid pressure method. The sizing of a 2 psi (13.8 kPa) gas piping system is performed using the traditional Longest Length Method but with modifications. The 2 psi 
(13.8 kPa) system consists of two independent pressure 

APPENDIX A 
zones, and each zone is sized separately. The Hybrid Pressure Method is applied as follows: 
The sizing of the 2 psi (13.8 kPa) section (from the meter to the line regulator) is as follows: 
(1) Calculate the gas load (by adding up the name plate ratings) from all connected appliances. (In certain circumstances the installed gas load may be increased up to 50 percent to accommodate future addition of appliances.) Ensure that the line regulator capacity is adequate for the calculated gas load and that the required pressure drop (across the regulator) for that capacity does not exceed 3/4 psi (5.2 kPa) for a 2 psi 
(13.8 kPa) system. If the pressure drop across the regulator is too high (for the connected gas load), select a larger regulator. 
(2) 
Measure 	the distance from the meter to the line regulator located inside the building. 

(3) 
If there 	are multiple line regulators, measure the distance from the meter to the regulator furthest removed from the meter. 

(
4) The maximum allowable pressure drop for the 2 psi 


(13.8 kPa) section is 1 psi (6.9 kPa). 

(5) 
Referring to the appropriate sizing table (based 	on piping material) for 2 psi (13.8 kPa) systems with a 1 psi (6.9 kPa) pressure drop, find this distance in the first column, or the closest larger distance if the exact distance is not listed. 

(
6) Trace across this row until the gas load is found or the closest larger capacity if the exact capacity is not listed. 

(7) 
Read up the table column to the top row and select the appropriate pipe size. 

(8) 
If there are multiple regulators in this portion of the piping system, each line segment must be sized for its actual gas load, but using the longest length previously determined above. 


The low pressure section (all piping downstream of the line regulator) is sized as follows: 
(1) 
Determine the gas load for each of the connected appliances. 

(2) 
Starting from the line regulator, divide the piping system into a number of connected segments and/or independent parallel piping segments, and determine the amount of gas that each segment would carry assuming that all appliances were operated simultaneously. An allowance (in equivalent length of pipe) as determined from Table A.2.2 should be considered for piping segments that include four or more fittings. 



(3) 
For each piping segment, 	use the actual length or longest length (if there are sub-branchlines) and the calculated gas load for that segment and begin the sizing process as follows: 

(a) 
Referring to the appropriate sizing table (based on operating pressure and piping material), find the longest length distance in the first column or the closest larger distance if the exact distance is not listed. The use of alternative operating pressures and/or pressure drops will require the use of a different sizing table, but will not alter the sizing methodology. In many cases, the use of alternative operating pressures and/or pressure drops may require the approval of the code official. 

(b) 	
Trace across this row until the appliance gas load is found or the closest larger capacity if the exact capacity is not listed. 

(c) 	
Read up the table column to the top row and select the appropriate pipe size. 

(d) 
Repeat this process for each segment of the piping system. 


A.3.4 Pressure drop per 100 feet method. This sizing method is less conservative than the others, but it allows the designer to immediately see where the largest pressure drop occurs in the system. With this information, modifications can be made to bring the total drop to the critical appliance within the limitations that are presented to the designer. 
Follow the procedures described in the Longest Length Method for Steps (1) through (4) and (9). 
For each piping segment, calculate the pressure drop based on pipe size, length as a percentage of 100 feet (30 480 mm) and gas flow. Table A.3.4 shows pressure drop per 100 feet (30 480 mm) for pipe sizes from 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) through 2 inches (51 mm). The sum of pressure drops to the critical appliance is subtracted from the supply pressure to verify that sufficient pressure will be available. If not, the layout can be examined to find the high drop section(s) and sizing selections modified. 
Note: Other values can be obtained by using the following equation: 
Desired Value = MBHx For example, if it is desired to get flow through 3/4-inch 

(J

(19.1 mm) pipe at 2 inches/100 feet, multiply the capacity of 
3/4-inch pipe at 1 inch/100 feet by the square root of the pressure ratio: 

= 147 x 1.414 = 208 MBH

EXAMPLES USING SINGLE APPLIANCE VENTING TABLES 
Example 1: Single draft-hood-equipped appliance. 
0 
An installer has a 120,000 British thermal unit (Btu) per hour input appliance with a 5-inch-diameter draft hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 10-foot-high Type B vent system. What size vent should be used assuming (a) a 5-foot lateral single-wall metal vent connector is used with two 90-degree elbows, or (b) a 5-foot lateral single-wall metal vent connec­
tor is used with three 90-degree elbows in the vent system? 
Solution: 
Table 504.2(2) should be used to solve this problem, because single-wall metal vent connectors are being used with a Type Bvent. 

(a) Read down the first column in Table 504.2(2) until the row associated with a 10-foot height and 5-foot lateral is found. Read across this row until a vent capacity greater than 120,000 Btu per hour is located in the shaded columns labeled "NAT Max" for draft-hood­
( 
equipped appliances. In this case, a 5-inch-diameter 
\J
\ 
vent has a capacity of 122,000 Btu per hour and may be used for this application. 
(b) If three 90-degree elbows are used in the vent system, then the maximum vent capacity listed in the tables must be reduced by 10 percent (see Section 504.2.3 for single appliance vents). This implies that the 5­inch-diameter vent has an adjusted capacity of only 110,000 Btu per hour. In this case, the vent system must be increased to 6 inches in diameter (see calculations below). 
122,000 (0.90) = 110,000 for 5-inch vent 
From Table 504.2(2), Select 6-inch vent 

186,000 (0.90) = 167,000; This is greater than the 
required 120,000. Therefore, use a 6-inch vent and 
connector where three elbows are used. 
Example 2: Single fan-assisted appliance. 

An installer has an 80,000 Btu per hour input fan-assisted appliance that must be installed using 10 feet of lateral con­nector attached to a 30-foot-high Type B vent. Two 90­degree elbows are needed for the installation. Can a single­wall metal vent connector be used for this application? 
Solution: 

Table 504.2(2) refers to the use of single-wall metal vent con­nectors with Type B vent. In the fust column fmd the row associated with a 30-foot height and a 10-foot lateral. Read across this row, looking at the FAN Min and FAN Max col­umns, to find that a 3-inch-diameter single-wall metal vent connector is not recolnmended. Moving to the next larger size single wall connector (4 inches), note that a 4-inch-diameter single-wall metal connector has a recommended minimum vent capacity of 91 ,000 Btu per hour and a recommended maximum vent capacity of 144,000 Btu per hour. The 80,000 Btu per hour fan-assisted appliance is outside this range, so the conclusion is that a single-wall metal vent connector can­not be used to vent this appliance using 10 feet of lateral for the connector. 
However, if the 80,000 Btu per hour input appliance could be moved to within 5 feet of the vertical vent, then a 4-inch single-wall metal connector could be used to vent the appliance. Table 504.2(2) shows the acceptable range of vent capacities for a 4-inch vent with 5 feet of lateral to be between 72,000 Btu per hour and 157,000 Btu per hour. 
If the appliance cannot be moved closer to the vertical vent, then Type B vent could be used as the connector material. In this case, Table 504.2(1) shows that for a 30-foot­high vent with 10 feet of lateral, the acceptable range of vent capacities for a 4-inch-diameter vent attached to a fan­assisted appliance is between 37,000 Btu per hour and 150,000 Btu per hour. 

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 British thermal unit per hour = 0.293 1 W. 
Table 504.2(1) is used when sizing Type B double-wall gas vent connected 
directly to the appliance. 
Note: The appliance may be either Category I draft hood equipped or fan­

assisted type. 
FIGURE B-1

APPLIANCE WITH A TYPE B DOUBLE-WALL VENT 

Example 3: Interpolating between table values. 
An installer has an 80,000 Btu per hour input appliance with a 4-inch-diameter draft hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 12-foot-high Type B vent. The vent connector has a 5-foot lateral length and is also Type B. Can this appliance be vented using a 4-inch-diameter vent? 


Solution: 
0

Table 504.2(1) is used in the case of an all Type B vent sys­tem. However, since there is no entry in Table 504.2(1) for a height of 12 feet, interpolation must be used. Read down the 4-inch diameter NAT Max column to the row associated with 10-foot height and 5-foot lateral to find the capacity value of 77,000 Btu per hour. Read further down to the 15­foot height, 5-foot lateral row to find the capacity value of 
0 87,000 Btu per hour. The difference between the 15-foot height capacity value and the 10-foot height capacity value is 10,000 Btu per hour. The capacity for a vent system with a 12-foot height is equal to the capacity for a 10-foot height plus 2/5 of the difference between the 10-foot and 15-foot height values, or 77,000 + 2/5 (10,000) = 81,000 Btu per hour. Therefore, a 4-inch-diameter vent may be used in the instal­lation.

EXAMPLES USING COMMON VENTING TABLES 
Example 4: Common venting two draft-hood-equipped appliances. 
A 35,000 Btu per hour water heater is to be common vented with a 150,000 Btu per hour furnace using a common vent with a total height of 30 feet. The connector rise is 2 feet for the water heater with a horizontal length of 4 feet. The con­nector rise for the furnace is 3 feet with a horizontal length of 8 feet. Assume single-wall metal connectors will be used with Type B vent. What size connectors and combined vent should be used in this installation? 
Solution: 
Table 504.3(2) should be used to size single-wall metal vent connectors attached to Type B vertical vents. In the vent con­nector capacity portion of Table 504.3(2), find the row asso­ciated with a 30-foot vent height. For a 2-foot rise on the vent connector for the water heater, read the shaded columns for draft-hood-equipped appliances to find that a 3-inch-diameter vent connector has a capacity of 37,000 Btu per hour. There­fore, a 3-inch single-wall metal vent connector may be used with the water heater. For a draft-hood-equipped furnace with a 3-foot rise, read across the appropriate row to find that a 5­inch-diameter vent connector has a maximum capacity of 120,000 Btu per hour (which is too small for the furnace) and a 6-inch-diameter vent connector has a maximum vent capac­ity of 172,000 Btu per hour. Therefore, a 6-inch-diameter vent connector should be used with the 150,000 Btu per hour

furnace. Since both vent connector horizontal lengths are less than the maximum lengths listed in Section 504.3.2, the table values may be used without adjustments. 
In the common vent capacity portion of Table 504.3(2), fmd the row associated with a 30-foot vent height and read over to the NAT + NAT portion of the 6-inch-diameter colunm to find a maximum combined capacity of 257,000 Btu per hour. Since the two appliances total only 185,000 Btu per hour, a 6-inch common vent may be used. 
Example Sa: Common venting a draft-hood-equipped water heater with a fan-assisted furnace into a Type B vent. 
(J

In this case, a 35,000 Btu per hour input draft-hood­equipped water heater with a 4-inch-diameter draft hood outlet, 2 feet of connector rise, and 4 feet of horizontal length is to be common vented with a 100,000 Btu per hour fan­assisted furnace with a 4:..inch-diameter flue collar, 3 feet of connector rise, and 6 feet of horizontal length. The common vent consists of a 30-foot height of Type B vent. What are the recommended vent diameters for each connector and the common vent? The installer would like to use a single-wall metal vent connector. 

Solution: [Table 504.3(2)]. 
Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Since the water

table values may be used without adjustments. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 504.3(2), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet and read across the 2-foot Connector Rise (R) row to the first Btu per 
hour rating in the NAT Max column that is equal to or greater than the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3­inch vent connector has a maximum input rating of 37,000 Btu per hour. Although this is greater than the water heater input rating, a 3-inch vent connector is prohibited by Section 
CJ 
504.3.21. A 4-inch vent connector has a maximum input rat­ing of 67,000 Btu per hour and is equal to the draft hood out­let diameter. A 4-inch vent connector is selected. Since the water heater is equipped with a draft hood, there are no mini­mum input rating restrictions. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 504.3(2), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet and across the 3-foot Connector Rise (R) row. Since the furnace has a fan-assisted combustion system, find the first FAN Max column with a Btu per hour rating greater than the furnace input rating. The 4-inch vent connector has a maximum input rating of 119,000 Btu per hour and a minimum input rating of 85,000 Btu per hour. The 100,000 Btu per hour furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4-inch connector is adequate. Since the furnace vent colll).ector horizontal length of 6 feet does not exceed the maximum value listed in Section 504.3.2, the venting table values may be used without adjustment. If the furnace had an input rating of 80,000 Btu per hour, then a Type B vent connector [see Table 504.3(1)] would be needed in order to meet the minimum capacity limit.

Common Vent Diameter; The total input to the common vent is 135,000 Btu per hour. Using the Common Vent Capacity portion of Table 504.3(2), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet and across this row to find the smallest vent diameter in the FAN + NAT column that has a Btu per hour rating equal to or greater than 135,000 Btu per hour. The 4-inch common vent has a capacity of 132,000 Btu per hour and the 5-inch common vent has a capacity of 202,000 Btu per hour. Therefore, the 5-inch common vent should be used in this example. 
Summary. In this example, the installer may use a 4-inch­diameter, single-wall metal vent connector for the water heater and a 4-inch-diameter, single-wall metal vent connector for the furnace. The common vent should be a 5­inch-diameter Type B vent. 
Example Sb: Common venting into a masonry chimney. 

In this case, the water heater and fan-assisted furnace of Example Sa are to be common vented into a clay tile-lined masonry chimney with a 30-foot height. The chimney is not exposed to the outdoors below the roof line. The internal dimensions of the clay tile liner are nominally 8 inches by 12 inches. Assuming the same vent connector heights, laterals, and materials found in Example Sa, what are the recom­mended vent connector diameters, and is this an acceptable installation? 
Solution: 

Table 504.3(4) is used to size common venting installations involving single-wall connectors into masonry chimneys.

2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE 
Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 504.3(4), Vent Connector Capacity, read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet, and read across the 2-foot Connector Rise (R) row to the first Btu per hour rating in the NAT Max column that is equal to or greater than the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3-inch vent connector has a maximum input of only 31 ,000 Btu per hour while a 4-inch vent connector has a maximum input of 57,000 Btu per hour. A 4-inch vent connector must therefore be used. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 504.3(4), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet and across the 3-foot Connector Rise (R) row. Since the furnace has a fan-assisted combustion system, fmd the fust FAN Max column with a Btu per hour rating greater than the furnace input rating. The 4-inch vent connector has a maximum input rating of 127,000 Btu per hour and a minimum input rating of 95,000 Btu per hour. The 100,000 Btu per hour furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4-inch connector is adequate. 
Masonry Chimney. From Table B-1, the equivalent area for a nominal liner size of 8 inches by 12 inches is 63.6 square inches. Using Table 504.3(4), Common Vent Capacity, read down the FAN + NAT column under the Minimum Internal Area of Chimney value of 63 to the row for 30-foot height to find a capacity value of 739,000 Btu per hour. The combined input rating of the furnace and water heater, 135,000 Btu per hour, is less than the table value, so this is an acceptable installation. 
Section 504.3.17 requires the common vent area to be no greater than seven times the smallest listed appliance categorized vent area, flue collar area, or draft hood outlet area. Both appliances in this installation have 4-inch-diameter outlets. From Table B-1, the equivalent area for an inside diameter of 4 inches is 12.2 square inches. Seven times 12.2 equals 85.4, which is greater than 63.6, so this configuration is acceptable. 
Example Sc: Common venting into an exterior masonry chimney. 
lri this case, the water heater and fan-assisted furnace of Examples Sa and 5b are to be common vented into an exterior masonry chimney. The chimney height, clay tile liner dimen­sions, and vent connector heights and laterals are the same as in Example 5b. This system is being installed in Charlotte, North Carolina. Does this exterior masonry chimney need to be relined? If so, what corrugated metallic liner size is recom­mended? What vent connector diameters are recommended? 
Solution: 
According to Section 504.3.20, Type B vent connectors are required to be used with exterior masonry chimneys. Use Tables 504.3(7a), (7b) to size FAN+NAT common venting installations involving Type-B double wall connectors into exterior masonry chimneys. 




The local 99-percent winter design temperature needed to use Table 504.3(7b) can be found in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. For Charlotte, North Carolina, this design temperature is 19°F. 


Chimney Liner Requirement. As in Example 5b, use the 63 square inch Internal Area columns for this size clay tile liner. Read down the 63 square inch column of Table 504.3(7a) to the 30-foot height row to find that the combined 
0

appliance maximum input is 747,000 Btu per hour. The combined input rating of the appliances in this installation, 135,000 Btu per hour, is less than the maximum value, so this criterion is satisfied. Table 504.3(7b), at a 19°F design temperature, and at the same vent height and internal area used above, shows that the minimum allowable input rating of a space-heating appliance is 470,000 Btu per hour. The .
'0I furnace input rating of 100,000 Btu per hour is less than this minimum value. So this criterion is not satisfied, and an alternative venting design needs to be used, such as a Type B vent shown in Example Sa or a listed chimney liner system shown in the remainder of the example. 
According to Section 504.3.19, Table 504.3(1) or 504.3(2) is used for sizing corrugated metallic liners in masonry chimneys, ·with the maximum common vent capacities reduced by 20 percent. This example will be continued assuming Type B vent connectors. 
Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 504.3(1), Vent Connector Capacity, read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet, and read across the 2-foot Connector Rise (R) row to the fust Btu/h rating in the NAT 
0 Max column that is equal to or greater than the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3-inch vent connector has a maximum capacity of 39,000 Btu/h. Although this rating is greater than the water heater input rating, a 3-inch vent connector is prohibited by Section 504.3.21. A 4-inch vent connector has a maximum input rating of 70,000 Btu/h and is equal to the draft hood outlet diameter. A 4-inch vent connector is selected. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 504.3(1), Vent Connector Capacity, read down the Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet, and read across the 3-foot Connector Rise 
(R) row to the fust Btu per hour rating in the FAN Max column that is equal to or greater than the furnace input rating. The 100,000 Btu per hour furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4-inch connector is adequate. ()
Chimney Liner Diameter. The total input to the common vent is 135,000 Btu per hour. Using the Common Vent Capacity Portion of Table 504.3(1), read down the Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet and across this row to find the smallest vent diameter in the FAN+NAT column that has a Btu per hour rating greater than 135,000 Btu per hour. The 4­inch common vent has a capacity of 138,000 Btu per hour. Reducing the maximum capacity by 20 percent (Section 504.3.19) results in a maximum capacity for a 4-inch corrugated liner of 110,000 Btu per hour, less than the total 

u 





2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE 

APPENDIX B 

input of 135,000 Btu per hour. So a larger liner is needed. The 5-inch common vent capacity listed in Table 504.3(1) is 210,000 Btu per hour, and after reducing by 20 percent is 168,000 Btu per hour. Therefore, a 5-inch corrugated metal liner should be used in this example.

Single-Wall Connectors. Once it has been established that relining the chimney is necessary, Type B double-wall vent connectors are not specifically required. This example could 
0 
be redone using Table 504.3(2) for single-wall vent connectors. For this case, the vent connector and liner diameters would be the same as found above with Type B double-wall connectors.

SECTION AJ1 01 
PURPOSE AND INTENT 

AJlOl.l General. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage the continued use or reuse of legally existing buildings and structures. These provisions are intended to permit work in existing buildings that is consistent with the purpose of this code. Compliance with these provisions shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this code. 
AJ101.2 Classification of work. For purposes of this appen­dix, all work in existing buildings shall be classified into the categories of repair, renovation, alteration and reconstruction. Specific requirements are established for each category of work in these provisions. 
AJ101.3 Multiple categories of work. Work of more than one category may be part of a single work project. All related work permitted within a 12-month period shall be considered · a single work project. Where a project includes one category of work in one building area and another category of work in a separate and unrelated area of the building, each project area shall comply with the requirements of the respective cat­egory of work. Where a project with more than one category of work is performed in the same area or in related areas of the building, the project shall comply with the requirements of the more stringent category of work. 
SECTION AJ1 02 
COMPLIANCE 

AJ102.1 General. Regardless of the category of work being performed, the work shall not cause the structure to become unsafe or adversely affect the performance of the building; 

2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE 
shall not cause an existing mechanical or plumbing system to become unsafe, hazardous, insanitary or overloaded; and unless expressly permitted by these provisions, shall not make the building any less compliant with this code or to any previously approved alternative arrangements than it was before the work was undertaken. AJ102.2 Requirements by category of work. Repairs shall conform to the requirements of Section AJ301. Renovations shall conform to the requirements of Section AJ401. Altera­tions shall conform to the requirements of Section AJ501 and the requirements for renovations. Reconstructions shall con­form to the requirements of Section AJ601 and the require­ments for alterations and renovations. 


AJ102.3 Smoke detectors. Regardless of the category of work, smoke detectors shall be provided where required by Section R314.3.1. 
AJ102.4 Replacement windows. Regardless of the category of work, when an existing window, including the sash and glazed portion, is replaced, the replacement window shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 11. 
AJ102.5 Flood hazard areas. Work performed in existing buildings located in a flood hazard area as established by Table R301.2(1) shall be subject to the provisions of Section R105.3.1.1. 
AJ102.6 Equivalent alternatives. These provisions are not intended to prevent the use of any alternative material, alter­native design or alternative method of construction not spe­cifically prescribed herein, provided any alternative has been deemed to be equivalent and its use authorized by the build­ing official. 
61 1 APPENDIX J 


AJ102.7 Other alternatives. Where compliance with these provisions or with this code as required by these provisions is technically infeasible or would impose disproportionate costs because of structural, construction or dimensional difficul­ties, other alternatives may be accepted by the building offi­cial. These alternatives may include materials, design features and{or operational features. 
AJ102.8 More restrictive requirements. Buildings or sys­tems in compliance with the requirements of this code for new construction shall not be required to comply with any more restrictive requirement of these provisions. 
AJ102.9 Features exceeding code requirements. Elements, components and systems of existing buildings with features that exceed the requirements of this code for new construc­tion, and are not otherwise required as part of approved alter­native arrangements or deemed by the building official to be required to balance other building elements not complying with this code for new construction, shall not be prevented by these provisions from being modified as long as they remain in compliance with the applicable requirements for new con­struction. 
SECTION AJ1 03 
PRELIMINARY MEETING

AP102.2 Demand load. 
APPENDIX P 
AP103.2.2 Water pipe sizing procedures are based on a system of pressure requirements and losses, the sum of which must not exceed the minimum pressure available at the supply source. These pressures are as follows: 
1. Pressure 	required at fixture to produce required flow. See Sections P2903.1 of this code and Section 
604.3 of the California Plumbing Code. 

2. 	Static pressure loss or gain (due to head) is com­puted at 0.433 psi per foot (9.8 kPa/m) of elevation change. 
Example: Assume that the highest fixture supply outlet is 20 feet (6096 mm) above or below the supply source. This produces a static pressure differential of 8.66 psi (59.8 kPa) loss [20 feet by 
0.433 psi per foot (2096 mm by 9.8 kPa/m)]. 
3. 	
Loss through water meter. The friction or pressure loss can be obtained from meter manufacturers. 

4. 
Loss through taps in water main. 

5. 	
Loss through special devices, such as filters, soften­ers, backflow prevention devices and pressure regu­lators. These values must be obtained from the manufacturer. 

6. 	
Loss through valves and fittings. Losses for these items are calculated by converting to the equivalent length of piping and adding to the total pipe length. 

7. 	
Loss caused by pipe friction can be calculated when the pipe size, pipe length and flow through the pipe are known. With these three items, the friction loss can be determined. For piping flow charts not included, use manufacturers' tables and velocity rec­ommendations.

AP103.3 Segmented loss method. The size of water service mains, branch mains and risers by the segmented loss method, must be determined according to water supply demand [gpm (Lim)], available water pressure [psi (kPa)] and friction loss caused by the water meter and developed length of pipe [feet (m)], including the equivalent length of fittings. This design procedure is based on the following parameters: 
1. 
The calculated friction loss through each length of pipe. 

2. 	
A system of pressure losses, the sum of which must not exceed the minimum pressure available at the street main or other source of supply. 

3. 
Pipe sizing based on estimated peak demand, total pres­sure losses caused by difference in elevation, equip­








ment, developed length and pressure required at the most remote fixture; loss through taps in water main; losses through fittings, filters, backflow prevention devices, valves and pipe friction. 


Because of the variable conditions encountered in hydrau­lic design, it is impractical to specify definite and detailed rules for the sizing of the water piping system. Current sizing 
methods do not address the differences in the probability of use and flow characteristics of fixtures between types occupancies. Creating an exact model of predicting the demand for a building is impossible and fmal studies assess­ing the impact of water conservation on demand are not yet complete. The following steps are necessary for the seg­mented loss method. 
0

1. 	Preliminary. Obtain the necessary information regard­
ing the minimum daily static service pressure in the 
area where the building is to be located. If the building 
supply is to be metered, obtain information regarding 
friction loss relative to the rate of flow for meters in the 
range of sizes to be used. Friction loss data can be 



obtained from manufacturers of water meters. Enough 

pressure must be available to overcome all system losses caused by friction and elevation so that plumbing fixtures operate properly. Section 604.6 of the Califor­nia Plumbing Code requires that the water distribution system be designed for the minimum pressure available taking into consideration pressure fluctuations. The lowest pressure must be selected to guarantee a contin­uous, adequate supply of water. The lowest pressure in the public main usually occurs in the summer because of lawn sprinkling and supplying water for air-condi­tioning cooling towers. Future demands placed on the public main as a result of large growth or expansion should also be considered. The available pressure will decrease as additional loads are placed on the public system. 





2. 	Demand load. Estimate the supply demand of the 
building main and the principal branches and risers of 
the system by totaling the corresponding demand from 
the applicable part of Table AP103.3(3). When estimat­
ing peak demand, sizing methods typically use water 
supply fixture units (w.s.f.u.) [see Table AP103.3(2)]. 
This numerical factor measures the load-producing 
effect of a single plumbing fixture of a given kind. The 


0 
use of fixture units can be applied to a single basic probability curve (or table), found in the various sizing methods [see Table AP103.3(3)]. The fixture units are then converted into a gpm (L/m) flow rate for estimat­ing demand. 
2. 1. Estimate 	continuous supply demand in gpm (L/m) for lawn sprinklers, air conditioners, etc., and add the sum to the total demand for fixtures. The result is the estimated supply demand for the building supply. Fixture units cannot be applied to constant-use fixtures, such as hose hibbs, lawn sprinklers and air 

u
conditioners. These types of fixtures must be assigned the gpm (Lim) value.

3. Selection of pipe size. This water pipe sizing procedure 
() 	is based on a system of pressure requirements and losses, the sum of which must not exceed the minimum pressure available at the supply source. These pressures are as follows: 
0 
3.1. Pressure required at the fixture to produce required flow. See Section P2903 .1 of this code and Section 604.3 of the California Plumbing 
Code. 
0 
3.2. 
Static pressure loss or gain (because of head) is computed at 0.433 psi per foot (9.8 kPa/m) of elevation change. 

3.3. Loss through a water meter. The friction 	or pressure loss can be obtained from the manu­
facturer. 
3.4. Loss through taps in water main [see Table AP103.3(4)]. 
3.5. Loss through special devices, such as filters, softeners, backflow prevention devices and pressure regulators. These values must be obtained from the manufacturers. 
3.6. Loss through valves and fittings [see Tables AP103.3(5) and AP103.3(6)]. Losses for these items are calculated by converting to the equiv­alent length of piping and adding to the total pipe length. 

CJ 

3.7. 
Loss caused by pipe friction can be calculated when the pipe size, pipe length and flow through the pipe are known. With these three items, the friction loss can be determined using Figures AP103.3(2) through AP103.3(7). When using charts, use pipe inside diameters. For pip­ing flow charts not included, use manufactur­ers' tables and velocity recommendations. Before attempting to size any water supply sys­tem, it is necessary to gather preliminary infor­mation which includes available pressure, piping material, select design velocity, eleva­tion differences and developed length to the most remote fixture. The water supply system is divided into sections at major changes in eleva­tion or where branches lead to fixture groups. 



The peak demand must be determined in each part of the hot and cold water supply system which includes the corresponding w.s.f.u. and conversion to gpm (L/m) flow rate to be expected through each section. Sizing methods require determination of the "most hydrauli­cally remote" fixture to compute the pressure loss caused by pipe and fittings. The hydrauli­cally remote fixture represents the most down­stream fixture along the circuit of piping requiring the most available pressure to operate properly. Consideration must be given to all pressure demands and losses, such as friction caused by pipe, fittings and equipment; eleva-


APPENDIX P 
tion; and the residual pressure required by Table P2903.1. The two most common and fre­quent complaints about water supply system operation are lack of adequate pressure and noise. 
Problem: What size Type L copper water pipe, service and 
distribution will be required to serve a two-story factory 
building having on each floor, back-to-hack, two toilet rooms 
each equipped with hot and cold water? The highest ftxture is 
21 feet above the street main, which is tapped with a 2-inch 
corporation cock at which point the minimum pressure is 55 
psi. In the building basement, a 2-inch meter with a maxi­
mum pressure drop of 11 psi and 3-inch reduced pressure 
principle backflow preventer with a maximum pressure drop 
of 9 psi are to be installed. The system is shown in Figure . 
AP103.3(1). To be determined are the pipe sizes for the ser­
vice main, and the cold and hot water distribution pipes. 

Solution: A tabular arrangement such as shown in Table AP103.3(1) should first be constructed. The steps to be followed are indicated by the tabular arrangement itself as they are in sequence, Columns 1 through 10 and Lines A through L. 
Step 1 

Columns 1 and 2: Divide the system into sections break­ing at major changes in elevation or where branches lead to fixture groups. Mter Point B [see Figure AP103.3(1)], separate consideration will be given to the hot and cold water piping. Enter the sections to be considered in the service and cold water piping in Column 1 of the tabular arrangement. Column 1 of Table AP103.3(1) provides a line-by-line, recommended tabular arrangement for use in solving pipe sizing. 
The objective in designing the water supply system is to ensure an adequate water supply and pressure to all fix­tures and equipment. Column 2 provides the psi (kPa) to be considered separately from the minimum pressure available at the main. Losses to take into consideration are the following: the differences in elevations ·between the water supply source and the highest water supply outlet; meter pressure losses; the tap in main loss; special fixture devices, such as water softeners and backflow prevention devices; and the pressure required at the most remote fix­ture outlet. 
The difference in elevation can result in an increase or decrease in available pressure at the main. Where the water supply outlet is located above the source, this results in a loss in the available pressure and is subtracted from the pressure at the water source. Where the highest water supply outlet is located below the water supply source, there will be an increase in pressure that is added to the available pressure of the water source. 
Column 3: According to Table AP103.3(3), determine the gpm (Lim) of flow to be expected in each section of the system. These flows range from 28.6 to 108 gpm. Load values for fixtures must be determined as w.s.f.u. and then converted to a gpm rating to determine peak demand. 







APPENDIX P 
When calculating peak demands, the w.s.f.u. are added and then converted to the gpm rating. For continuous flow fixtures, such as hose hibbs and lawn sprinkler systems, add the gpm demand to the intermittent demand of fiX­tures. For example, a total of 120 w.s.f.u. is converted to a demand of 48 gpm. Two hose hibbs x 5 gpm demand = 10 gpm. Total gpm rating = 48.0 gpm + 10 gpm = 58.0 gpm demand. 
Step 2 
Line A: Enter the minimum pressure available at the main source of supply in Column 2. This is 55 psi (379.2 kPa). The local water authorities generally keep records of pres­sures at different times of the day and year. The available pressure can also be checked from nearby buildings or from fire department hydrant checks. 
Line B: Determine from Table P2903.1 the highest pres­sure required for the fixtures on the system, which is 15 psi (103.4 kPa), to operate a flushometer valve. The most remote fixture outlet is necessary to compute the pressure loss caused by pipe and fittings, and represents the most downstream fixture along the circuit of piping requiring the available pressure to operate properly as indicated by Table P2903.1. 
Line C: Determine the pressure loss for the meter size given or assumed. The total water flow from the main through the service as determined in Step 1 will serve to aid in the meter selected. There are three common types of water meters; the pressure losses are determined by the American Water Works Association Standards for dis­placement type, compound type and turbine type. The maximum pressure loss of such devices takes into consid­eration the meter size, safe operating capacity [gpm (Urn)]and maximum rates for continuous operations [gpm (Um)] . Typically, equipment imparts greater pressure losses than piping. 
Line D: Select from Table AP103.3(4) and enter the pres­sure loss for the tap size given or assumed. The loss of pressure through taps and tees in psi (kPa) is based on the total gpm (L/m) flow rate and size of the tap. 
Line E: Determine the difference in elevation between the main and source of supply and the highest fixture on the system. Multiply this figure, expressed in feet (mm), by 
0.43 psi. Enter the resulting psi (kPa) loss on Line E. The difference in elevation between the water supply source and the highest water supply outlet has a significant impact on the sizing of the water supply system. The dif­ference in elevation usually results in a loss in the avail­able pressure because the water supply outlet is generally located above the water supply source. The loss is caused by the pressure required to lift the water to the outlet. The pressure loss is subtracted from the pressure at the water source. Where the highest water supply outlet is located below the water source, there will be an increase in pres­sure which is added to the available pressure of the water source. 



Lines F, G and H: The pressure losses through ftlters, 
backflow prevention devices or other special fixtures must 

0

be obtained from the manufacturer or estimated and 
entered on these lines. Equipment, such as backflow pre­
vention devices, check valves, water softeners, instanta­
neous, or tankless water heaters, ftlters and strainers, can 
impart a much greater pressure loss than the piping. The 
pressure losses can range from 8 to 30 psi. 

0

Step 3 
Line 1: The sum of the pressure requirements and losses 
that affect the overall system (Lines B through H) is 
entered on this line. Summarizing the steps, all of the sys­
tem losses are subtracted from the minimum water pres­
sure. The remainder is the pressure available for friction, 

0

defined as the energy available to push the water through 
the pipes to each fixture. This force can be used as an aver­
age pressure loss, as long as the pressure available for fric­
tion is not exceeded. Saving a certain amount for available 
water supply pressures as an area incurs growth, or 
because of the aging of the pipe or equipment added to the 
system is recommended. 

Step 4 
Line J: Subtract Line I from Line A. This gives the pres­
sure that remains available from overcoming friction 
losses in the system. This figure is a guide to the pipe size 
that is chosen for each section, incorporating the total fric­
tion losses to the most remote outlet (measured length is 
called developed length). 


Exception: When the main is above the highest ftxture, the resulting psi (kPa) must be considered a pressure gain (static head gain) and omitted from the sums of Lines B through H and added to Line J. 
The maximum friction head loss that can be toler­ated in the system during peak demand is the difference between the static pressure at the highest and most remote outlet at no-flow conditions and the minimum flow pressure required at that outlet. If the losses are within the required limits, every run of pipe will also be within the required friction head loss. Static · pressure loss is at the most remote outlet in feet x 0.433 = loss in psi caused by elevation differences. 


Step S 
0

Column 4: Enter the length of each section from the main 
to the most remote outlet (at Point E). Divide the water 
supply system into sections breaking at major changes in 
elevation or where branches lead to ftxture groups. 

Step 6 
Column 5: When selecting a trial pipe size, the length 
from the water service or meter to the most remote fixture 
outlet must be measured to determine the developed 
length. However, in systems having a flushometer valve or 
temperature-controlled shower at the topmost floors, the 
developed length would be from the water meter to the 
most remote flushometer valve on the system. A rule of 


2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE 


0 thumb is that size will become progressively smaller as the system extends farther from the main source of supply. Trial pipe size may be arrived at by the following formula: 
Line J: (Pressure available to overcome pipe friction) x 100/equivalent length of run total developed length to most remote fixture x percentage factor of 1.5 (Note: a percentage factor is used only as an estimate for friction losses imposed for fittings for initial trial pipe size) = psi (average pressure drop per 100 feet of pipe). 

0 
For trial pipe size, see Figure AP103.3(3) (Type L cop­per) based on 2.77 psi and 108 gpm = 21/2 inches. To determine the equivalent length of run to the most remote outlet, the developed length is determined and added to the friction losses for fittings and valves. The developed 
lengths of the designated pipe sections are as follows: 
A-B 54 feet 
B-C 8 feet 
C-D 13 feet 
D-E 150 feet 
Total developed length = 225 feet The equivalent length of the friction loss in fittings and valves must be added to the developed length (most remote outlet). Where the size of fittings and valves is not known, the added friction loss should be approximated. A general rule that has been used is to add SO percent of the developed length to allow for fittings and valves. For example, the equivalent length of run equals the developed length of run (225 feet x 1.5 = 338 feet). The total equiva­lent length of run for determining a trial pipe size is 338 feet. 

Example: 9.36 (pressure available to overcome pipe friction) x 100/338 (equivalent length of run = 225 x .1.5) = 2.77 psi (average pressure drop per 100 feet of 
pipe). 
Step 7 
Column 6: Select from Table AP103.3(6) the equivalent lengths for the trial pipe size of fittings and valves on each pipe section. Enter the sum for each section in Column 6. (The number of fittings to be used in this example must be an estimate). The equivalent length of piping is the devel­oped length plus the equivalent lengths of pipe corre­sponding to the friction head losses for fittings and valves. Where the size of fittings and valves is not known, the added friction head losses must be approximated. An esti­mate for this example is found in Table AP.l. 


Step S 
Column 7: Add the figures from Columns 4 and 6, and enter in Column 7. Express the sum in hundreds of feet. 
l) 
Step 9 
Column 8: Select from Figure AP103.3(3) the friction loss per 100 feet of pipe for the gpm flow in a section 
APPENDIX P 
(Column 3) and trial pipe size (Column 5). Maximum fric­tion head loss per 100 feet is determined on the basis of the total pressure available for friction head loss and the longest equivalent length of run. The selection is based on the gpm demand, uniform friction head loss and maximum design velocity. Where the size indicated by the hydraulic table indicates a velocity in excess of the selected velocity, a size must be selected which produces the required veloc­ity. 
Step 10 
Column 9: Multiply the figures in Columns 7 and 8 for each section and enter in Column 9. 
Total friction loss is determined by multiplying the fric­tion loss per 100 feet for each pipe section in the total developed length by the pressure loss in fittings expressed as equivalent length in feet (mm). Note: Section C-F should be considered in the total pipe friction losses only if greater loss occurs in Section C-F than in pipe Section D-E. Section C-F is not considered in the total developed length. Total friction loss in equivalent length is deter­mined in Table AP.2. 
Step 11 
Line K: Enter the sum of the values in Column 9. The value is the total friction loss in equivalent length for each designated pipe section. 
Step 12 Line L: Subtract Line J from Line K and enter in Column 
10. 

The result should always be a positive or plus figure. If it is not, repeat the operation using Columns 5, 6, 8 and 9 until a balance or near balance is obtained. If the differ­ence between Lines J and K is a high positive number, it is an indication that the pipe sizes are too large and should be reduced, thus saving materials. In such a case, the opera­tions using Columns 5, 6, 8 and 9 should be repeated. 
The total friction losses are determined and subtracted from the pressure available to overcome pipe friction for the trial pipe size. This number is critical because it pro­vides a guide to whether the pipe size selected is too large and the process should be repeated to obtain an economi­cally designed system. 
Answer: The final figures entered in Column 5 become the design pipe size for the respective sections. Repeating this operation a second time using the same sketch but consider­ing the demand for hot water, it is possible to size the hot water distribution piping. This has been worked up as a part of the overall problem in the tabular arrangement used for sizing the service and water distribution piping. Note that consideration must be given to the pressure losses from the street main to the water heater (Section A-B) in determining the hot water pipe sizes.

FRICTION LOSS IN ROUGH PIPE" 




APPENDIX P 
SECTION AP201 
SELECTION OF PIPE SIZE 

AP201.1 Size of water-service mains, branch mains and risers. The minimum size water service pipe shall be 3/4 inch 
(19.1 mm). The size of water service mains, branch mains and risers shall be determined according to water supply demand [gpm (L/m)], available water pressure [psi (kPa)] and friction loss caused by the water meter and developed length of pipe [feet (m)], including the equivalent length of fittings. The size of each water distribution system shall be deter­mined according to the procedure outlined in this section or by other design methods conforming to acceptable engineer­ing practice and approved by the building official: 
1. 	
Supply load in the building water distribution system shall be determined by the total load on the pipe being sized, in terms of w.s.f.u., as shown in Table AP103.3(2). For fixtures not listed, choose a w.s.f.u. value of a fixture with similar flow characteristics. 

2. 	
Obtain the minimum daily static service pressure [psi (kPa)] available (as determined by the local water authority) at the water meter or other source of supply at the installation location. Adjust this minimum daily static pressure [psi (kPa)] for the following conditions: 


2.1. Determine the difference in elevation between the source 9f supply and the highest water sup­ply outlet. Where the highest water supply out­let is located above the source of supply, deduct 
0.5 psi (3.4 kPa) for each foot (0.3 m) of differ­ence in elevation. Where the highest water sup­ply outlet is located below the source of supply, add 0.5 psi (3.4 kPa) for each foot (0.3 m) of difference in elevation. 
2.2. Where a water pressure-reducing valve is installed in the water distribution system, the minimum daily static water pressure available is 80 percent of the minimum daily static water pressure at the source of supply or the set pres­sure downstream of the water pressure-reducing valve, whichever is smaller. 
2.3. Deduct all pressure losses caused by special equipment, such as a backflow preventer, water filter and water softener. Pressure loss data for each piece of equipment shall be obtained through the manufacturer of the device. 
2.4. 
Deduct the pressure in excess of 8 psi (55 kPa) resulting from the installation of the special plumbing fixture, such as temperature-con­trolled shower and flushometer tank water closet. Using the resulting minimum available pressure, find the corresponding pressure range in Table AP201.1. 

3. 	
The maximum developed length for water piping is the actual length of pipe between the source of supply and the most remote fixture, including either hot (through the water heater) or cold water branches multiplied by a 



factor of 1.2 to compensate for pressure loss through 
fittings. Select the appropriate column in Table 

0 
AP201.1 equal to or greater than the calculated maxi­
mum developed length. 


4. 	To determine the size of the water service pipe, meter and main distribution pipe to the building using the appropriate table, follow down the selected "maximum developed length" column to a fixture unit equal to or 
0
greater than the total installation demand calculated by 
using the "combined" w.s.f.u. column of Table 
AP201.1. Read the water service pipe and meter sizes 
in the first left-hand column and the main distribution 
pipe to the building in the second left-hand column on 
the same row. 

0

5. 	To determine the size of each water distribution pipe, start at the most remote outlet on each branch (either hot or cold branch) and, working back toward the main distribution pipe to the building, add up the w.s.f.u. demand passing through each segment of the distribu­tion system using the related hot or cold column of Table AP201.1. Knowing demand, the size of each seg­ment shall be read from the second left-hand column of the same table and the maximum developed length col­umn selected in Steps 1 and 2, under the same or next smaller size meter row. In no case does the size of any branch or main need to be larger that the size of the main distribution pipe to the building established in Step 4.
