This document is the 5th of 12 Parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building Standards Code. Part 5 is known as the California Plumbing Code and incorporates, by adoption, the 20 12 edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code of the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials with the California amend­ments. 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legislature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various State agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building regula­tions or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipulated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 

A city, county or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effective sooner than the effective date of this edition of California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applic­able to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing. 
To familiarize yourself with the format of this code, it is suggested that users review the following contents: 

•

• 
Matrix Adoption Tables

UPC FOREWORD 
Not Adopted by The State of California 

The advantages of a uniform plumbing code adopted by various local jurisdictions has long been recognized. Disorder in the industry as a result of widely divergent plumbing practices and the use of many different, often conflicting, plumbing codes by local jurisdictions influenced the Western Plumbing Officials Association (now the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials [IAPMO]) to form a committee of plumbing inspectors, master and journeyman plumbers, and sani­tary and mechanical engineers, assisted by public utility companies and the plumbing industry to create a basic plumbing 
0 document for general use. The product of this effort, the first edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code ® (UPC®) was officially adopted by IAPMO in 1945. The widespread use of this code over the past five decades by jurisdictions throughout the United States and internationally is testament to its merit. 

With the publication of the 2003 Edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code ®, another significant milestone was reached. For the 
0 
first time in the history of the United States, a plumbing code was developed through a true consensus process. The 2012 edition represents the most current approaches in the plumbing field and is the fourth edition developed under the ANSI consensus process. Contributions to the content of the code were made by every segment of the built industry, including such 

diverse interests as consumers, enforcing authorities, installers/maintainers, insurance, labor, manufacturers, research/stan­dards/testing laboratories, special experts, and users. 
The UPC is designed to provide consumers with safe and sanitary plumbing systems while, at the same time, allowing lati­tude for innovation and new technologies. The public at large is encouraged and invited to participate in IAPMO's open consensus code development process. This code is updated every three years. A code development timeline and other relevant information is available at IAPMO's website at www.iapmo.org. 
The Uniform Plumbing Code ® is dedicated to all those who, in working to achieve "the ultimate plumbing code," have unselfishly devoted their time, effort, and personal funds to create and maintain this, the finest plumbing code in existence today. 

The 2012 Uniform Plumbing Code ® is supported by the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), the Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA), the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors National Association (PHCC-NA), the United Association (UA), and the World Plumbing Council (WPC). The presence of these logos, while reflecting support, does not imply any ownership of the copyright to the UPC, which is held exclusively by IAPMO. Further, the logos of these associations indicates the support ofiAPMO's open, consensus process being used to develop IAPMO's codes and standards.

CALIFORNIA MATRIX ADOPTION TABLES 


Format of the Matrix Adoption Tables 


The matrix adoption tables, examples of which follow, are non-regulatory aids intended to show the user which state agencies have adopted and/or amended given sections of model code. An agency's statutory authority for certain occupancies or building applications determines which chapter or section may be adopted, repealed, amended or added. See Chapter 1, Division I, Sections 1.2.0 through 1.14.0, for agency authority, building application and enforcement responsibilities. 
C)

The side headings identify the scope of the state agencies' adoption as follows : 
Adopt the entire UPC chapter without state amendments. 
If there is an "X" under a particular state agency's acronym in this row, it means that particular state agency has adopted the entire model code chapter without any state amendments. 


Example: 
CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE -MATRIX ADOPTION TABLE CHAPTER 1 -ADMINISTRATION 
(Matrix Adoption Tables are non-regulatory, intended only as an aid to the user. See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building application.) 

Adopt the entire UPC chapter as amended, state-amended sections are listed below: 
If there is an "X" under a particular state agency's acronym in this row, it means that a particular state agency has adopted the entire model code chapter, with state amendments. 
Each state-amended section that the agency has added to that particular chapter is listed. There will be an "X" in the column, by that particular section, under the agency's acronym, as well as an "X" by each section that the agency has adopted. 

Example:

21 
( 
'
' 
\___)l 





mit and the plans, specifications, and other data filed there­with are in accordance with the requirements of the code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees speci­fied in Section 103.4 have been paid, the Authority Having Jurisdiction shall issue a permit therefore to the applicant.

require additional review, a fee shall be charged at the 
rate shown in Table 103.4. 

103.4.2 Expiration of Plan Review. Applications for 
which no permit is issued within 180 days following the 
date of application shall expire by limitation, plans and

103.5.6.4 Tightness. Joints and connections in the plumbing system shall be gastight and watertight for the pressures required by the test. 
103.5.7 Inspection Requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the Authority Having Jurisdiction that such work is ready for inspection. The Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be permitted to require that a request for inspection be filed not less than 1 working day before such inspection is desired. Such request shall be in writing or by tele­phone, at the option of the Authority Having Jurisdiction. 
It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspec­tions in accordance with this code to provide access to and means for inspection of such work. 
103.5.7.1 Advance Notice.

Parts of the plumbing systems of a building or part thereof that is moved from one foundation to another, or from one loca­tion to another, shall be completely tested as pre­scribed elsewhere in this section for new work, except that walls or floors need not be removed dur­ing such test where other equivalent means of inspection acceptable to the Authority Having Juris­diction are provided. 
103.5.9 Reinspections. A reinspection fee shall be per­mitted to be assessed for each inspection or reinspection where such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or where required corrections have not been made. 
This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for fail­ure to be in accordance with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspec­tions before the job is ready for inspection or reinspec­tion. 
Reinspection fees shall be permitted to be assessed where the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which the inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Authority Having Jurisdiction.

ing Jurisdiction shall be permitted to authorize tempo­
rary connection of the plumbing equipment to the source 

t)

of energy or fuel for the purpose of testing the equipment. 
103.7 Unconstitutional.

and fittings shall be obtained from the same sources. Pres­sure losses through water-treating equipment, backflow prevention devices, or other flow-restricting devices shall be computed in accordance with Section 610.2. 
610.7 Conditions for Using Table 610.4. On a proposed water piping installation sized using Table 610.4, the fol­lowing conditions shall be determined: 


(1) 	
Total number of fixture units as determined from Table 610.3, Equivalent Fixture Units, for the fixtures to be installed. 

(2) 	
Developed length of supply pipe from meter to most remote outlet. 

(3) 	
Difference in elevation between the meter or other source of supply and the highest fixture or outlet. 

(4) 	
Pressure in the street main or other source of supply at the locality where the installation is to be made. 

(5) 	
In localities where there is a fluctuation of pressure in the main throughout the day, the water piping system shall be designed on the basis of the minimum pressure available. 




610.8 Size of Meter and Building Supply Pipe Using Table 610.4. The size of the meter and the building supply pipe shall be determined as follows: 
(1) 	
Determine the available pressure at the water meter or other source of supply. 

(2) 
Add or subtract depending on positive or negative ele­

vation change, 1;2 psi (3.4 kPa) for each foot (305 mm) 
of difference in elevation between such source of sup­
ply and the highest water supply outlet in the building 
or on the premises. 


(3) 	
Use the "pressure range" group within which this pres­sure will fall using Table 610.4. 

(4) 	
Select the "length" column that is equal to or longer than the required length. 

(5) 	
Follow down the column to a fixture unit value equal to or exceeding the total number of fixture units required by the installation. 

(6) 	
Having located the proper fixture unit value for the required length, sizes of meter and building supply pipe as found in the two left-hand columns shall be applied. 


0 


No building supply pipe shall be less than  of an inch (20 mm) in diameter. 
610.9 Size of Branches. Where Table 610.4 is used, the minimum size of each branch shall be determined by the number of fixture units to be served by that branch, the total developed length of the system, and the meter and street service size in accordance with Section 610.8. No branch piping is required to be larger in size than that required by Table 610.4 for the building supply pipe.

Total = 12 DFUs 

Using Table 1014.3.6, the grease interceptor will be sized 
at 750 gallons (2389 L). 

1016.0 Sand Interceptors. 
1016.1 Discharge. Where the discharge of a fixture or 
drain contain solids or semi-solids heavier than water that 
would be harmful to a drainage system or cause a stoppage 
within the system, the discharge shall be through a sand 

interceptor. Multiple floor drains shall be permitted to dis­
charge into one sand interceptor. 
1016.2 Authority Having Jurisdiction. Sand interceptors 

are required where the Authority Having Jurisdiction 
deems it advisable to have a sand interceptor to protect the 
drainage system. 

1016.3 Construction and Size. Sand interceptors shall be 
built of brick or concrete, prefabricated coated steel, or 
other watertight material. The interceptor shall have an 
interior baffle for full separation of the interceptor into two 
sections. The outlet pipe shall be the same size as the inlet 
pipe of the sand interceptor, the minimum being 3 inches 
(80 mm), and the baffle shall have two openings of the 
same diameter as the outlet pipe and at the same invert as 
the outlet pipe. These openings shall be staggered so that 
there cannot be a straight line flow between the inlet pipe 
and the outlet pipe. The invert of the inlet pipe shall be no 
lower than the invert of the outlet pipe. 

The sand interceptor shall have a minimum dimension of 2 square feet (0.2 m2) for the net free opening of the inlet section and a minimum depth under the invert of the outlet pipe of2 feet (610 mm). 
For each 5 gpm (0.3 Lis) flow or fraction thereof over 20 gpm (1.26 Lis), the area of the sand interceptor inlet sec­tion is to be increased by 1 square foot (0.09 m2). The out­let section shall at all times have a minimum area of 50 per­cent of the inlet section. 
The outlet section shall be covered by a solid remov­able cover, set flush with the finished floor, and the inlet section shall have an open grating, set flush with the fin­ished floor and suitable for the traffic in the area in which it is located. 
1016.4 Separate Use. Sand and similar interceptors for every solid shall be so designed and located as to be readily accessible for cleaning, shall have a water seal of not less than 6 inches (152 mm), and shall be vented.

1109.0 Testing. 1109.1 Testing Required. New building storm drainage systems and parts of existing systems that have been altered, extended, or repaired shall be tested in accordance with Section 1109.2.1 or Section 1109.2.2 to disclose leaks and defects. 
1109.2 Methods of Testing Storm Drainage Systems. 
Except for outside leaders and perforated or open-jointed drain tile, the piping of storm drain systems shall be tested upon completion of the rough piping installation by water or air, except that plastic pipe shall not be tested with air, and proved tight. The Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be permitted to require the removal of cleanout plugs to ascertain whether the pressure has reached parts of the system. One of the following test methods shall be used in accordance with Section 1109.2.1 through Section 1109.2.3. 
1109.2.1 Water Test. After piping has been installed, the water test shall be applied to the drainage system, either to the entire system or to sections. Where the test is applied to the entire system, all openings in the piping shall be tightly closed except for the highest opening, and the system shall be filled with water to the point of overflow. Where the system is tested in sections, each opening shall be tightly plugged except for the highest opening of the section under test, and each section shall be filled with water, but no section shall be tested with less than a 10 foot (3048 mm) head of water. In testing successive sections, not less than the upper 10 feet (3048 mm) of the next preceding section shall be tested so that no joint of pipe in the building except the uppermost 10 feet (3048 mm) of a roof drainage system, which shall be filled with water to the flood level of the uppermost roof drain, shall have been submitted to a test of less than 10 foot (3048 mm) head of water. The water shall be kept in the system or in the portion under test for not less than 15 minutes before inspection starts; the system shall then be tight. 

STORM DRAINAGE 
1109.2.2 Air Test. The air test shall be made by attaching an air compressor testing apparatus to a suit­able opening after closing other inlets and outlets to the system, forcing air into the system until there is a uniform gauge pressure of 5 pounds-force per square inch (psi) (34 kPa) or sufficient pressure to balance a column of mercury 10 inches (34 kPa) in height. This pressure shall be held without introduction of addi­tional air for a period of not less than 15 minutes. 
1109.2.3 Exceptions. Where circumstances exist that make air and water tests described in Section 1109.2.1 and Section 1109.2.2 impractical, see Section 
103.5.6.3.

1215.0 Required Gas Supply. 1215.1 General. The following regulations, shall comply I with this section and Section 1216.0, shall be the standard for the installation of gas piping. Natural gas regulations and ta­bles are based on the use of gas having a specific gravity of 0.60, supplied at 6 to 8 inches water column (1.5 kPa to 1.9 kPa) pressure at the outlet of the meter or regulator. For undi­luted liquefied petroleum gas, gas piping shall be permitted to be sized at 11 inches water column (2.7 kPa) pressure at the outlet of the meter or regulator and specific gravity of 1.50. Where gas of a different specific gravity is to be delivered, the specific gravity conversion factors provided by the serving 
gas supplier shall be used in sizing piping systems from the 

pipe sizing tables in this chapter. 
1215.2 Volume. The hourly volume of gas required at each 
piping outlet shall be taken as not less than the maximum 
hourly rating as specified by the manufacturer of the appli­
ance or appliances to be connected to each such outlet. 

1215.3 Gas Appliances. Where the gas appliances to be in­
stalled have not been definitely specified, Table 1208.4.1 shall 
be permitted to be used as a reference to estimate require­
ments of typical appliances. 

To obtain the cubic feet per hour (m3/h) of gas required, divide the input of the appliances by the average Btu (kW•h) heating value per cubic foot (m3) of the gas. The average Btu (kW•h) per cubic foot (m3) of the gas in the area ofthe in­stallation shall be permitted to be obtained from the serving gas supplier. 
1215.4 Size of Piping Outlets. The size of the supply piping outlet for a gas appliance shall be not less than Vz of an inch (15 mm). 
The size of a piping outlet for a mobile home shall be not less than % of an inch (20 mm). 
1216.0 Required Gas Piping Size. 1216.1 Pipe Sizing Methods. Where the pipe size is to be determined using a method in Section 1216.1.1 through Sec­
216 
tion 1216.1.3, the diameter of each pipe segment shall be ob­tained from the pipe sizing tables in Section 1216.2 or from 
C)

the sizing equations in Section 1216.3. [NFPA 54:6.1] 1216.1.1 Longest Length Method. The pipe size of each section of gas piping shall be determined using the longest length of piping from the point of delivery to the 
most remote outlet and the load of the section (see cal­
culation example in Figure 1216.1.1). [NFPA 54:6.1.1] 
1216.1.2 Branch Length Method. Pipe shall be sized 



as follows: 
(1) 	The pipe size of each section of the longest pipe run 
from the point of delivery to the most remote outlet 
shall be determined using the longest run of piping 

CJ

and the load of the section. 
(2) 	The pipe size of each section of branch piping not 
previously sized shall be determined using the 
length of piping from the point of delivery to the 
most remote outlet in each branch and the load of 
the section. [NFPA 54:6.1.2] 

1216.1.3 Hybrid Pressure. The pipe size for each sec­
tion of higher pressure gas piping shall be determined 
using the longest length of piping from the point of de­
livery to the most remote line pressure regulator. The 
pipe size from the line pressure regulator to each outlet 
shall be determined using the length of piping from the 
regulator to the most remote outlet served by the regula­
tor. [NFPA 54:6.1.3] 



1216.2 Tables for Sizing Gas Piping Systems. Table 1216.2(1) through Table 1216.2(36) shall be used to size gas piping in conjunction with one of the methods described in Section 1216.1.1 through Section 1216.1.3. [NFPA 54:6.2] 
1216.3 Sizing Equations. The inside diameter of smooth­wall pipe or tubing shall be determined by Equation 1216.3(1), Equation 1216.3(2), Table 1216.3, and using the 
I 

equivalent pipe length determined by Section 1216.1.1 through Section 1216.1.3. [NFPA 54:6.4]

(6) 	Size each section of branch piping not previously sized by measuring the distance from the gas meter location to the most remote outlet in that branch and follow the pro­cedures of steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 above. Size branch piping in the order of their distance from the meter location, be­ginning with the most distant outlet not previously sized. 
1216.5 Engineering Methods. For conditions other than those covered by Section 1216.1, such as longer runs or greater gas demands, the size of each gas piping system shall be determined by standard engineering methods acceptable to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, and each such system shall be so designed that the total pressure drop between the meter or other point of supply and an outlet where full de­mand is being supplied to all outlets, shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 1208.4. 
1216.6 Variable Gas Pressure. Where the gas pressure ex­ceeds 14 inches (3.5 kPa) or less than 6 inches (1.5 kPa) of water column, or where diversity demand factors are used, the design, pipe, sizing, materials, location, and use of such systems first shall be approved by the Authority Having Ju­risdiction. Piping systems designed for pressures exceeding the serving gas supplier's standard delivery pressure shall have prior verification from the gas supplier of the availabil­ity of the design pressure.

1216.4 Sizing of Piping Sections. To determine the size of I each section of pipe in a system within the range of Table 1216.2(1) through Table 1216.2(36), proceed as follows: 
(1) 	Measure the length of the pipe from the gas meter loca­

tion to the most remote outlet on the system. r\ (2) Select the length in feet column and row showing the dis­\'----) tance, or the next longer distance where the table does 
not give the exact length. 

Starting at the most remote outlet, fmd in the row just se­lected the gas demand for that outlet. Where the exact figure of demand is not shown, choose the next larger 
figure in the row. 
(4) 	At the top of this column will be found the correct size of pipe. 
Using this same row, proceed in a similar manner for each section of pipe serving this outlet. For each section of pipe, determine the total gas demand supplied by that 


\_. ___//i 
section. Where gas piping sections serve both heating 
and cooling appliances and the installation prevents both 
units from operating simUltaneously, the larger of the two 
demand loads needs to be used in sizing these sections.

(4) 
Motor requirements and controls 

(5) 	
Systems having nonstandard operating pressures, except as addressed in this chapter 



· 

(6) 
Waste anesthetic gas disposal (WAGD) systems 

(7) 
Surface-mounted medical gas rail systems 1309.6 Requirements. The requirements of this chapter shall not be interpreted to conflict with the requirements of

0 

by a supplier or agency other than the manufacturer. 
[NFPA 99:5.1.10.1.1] 1310.1.1 Components. Components include but are 
not limited to containers, valves, valve seats; lubri­cants, fittings, gaskets, and interconnecting equipment including hose. Easily ignitable materials shall be avoided. 
Compatibility involves both combustibility and 
ease of ignition. Materials that bum in air will bum 
violently in pure oxygen at normal pressure and explo­
sively in pressurized oxygen. Also, many materials that 
do not burn in air will do so in pure oxygen, particu­
larly under pressure. Metals for containers and piping 
have to be carefully selected, depending on service 
conditions. The various steels are acceptable for many 
applications, but some service conditions are capable 
of calling for other materials (usually copper or its 
alloys) because of their greater resistance to ignition 
and lower rate of combustion. Similarly, materials that 

are capable of being ignited in air have lower ignition 
energies in oxygen. Many such materials are capable 

of being ignited by friction at a valve seat, stem 
packing or by adiabatic compression produced where 

oxygen at high pressure is rapidly introduced into a 
system initially_at low pressure. 



1310.1.2 Materials. Materials used in central supply 
systems shall meet the following requirement. [NFPA 

99:5.1.3.4.4] ' 
0 

In those portions of systems intended to handle oxygen or nitrous oxide at gauge pressures of less than 300 pounds-force per square inches (psi) (2068 kPa), material construction shall be compatible with oxygen under the temperatures and pressures to which the components are capable of being exposed in the ( 
containment and use of oxygen, nitrous oxide, mixtures of these gases, or mixtures containing more than 23.5 percent oxygen. [NFPA 99:5.1.3.4.4{2)] 
1310.2 Certification. Certification of medical gas and medical vacuum systems shall comply with the require­
· 

ments of Section 1327.0 of this code, the Authority Having Jurisdiction, and NFPA 99. I 1310.3 Documentation. Prior to installation work, the installer of medical gas and · vacuum piping shall provide 







HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND MEDICAL GAS AND VACUUM SYSTEMS 
and maintain documentation on the job site for the qualifi­cation of brazing procedures and individual brazers that are 

CJ 
required under Section 1310.6. [NFPA 99:5.1.10.10.11.4] 1310.3.1 Delivery. Each length of tube shall be deliv­ered plugged or capped by the manufacturer and kept sealed until prepared for installation. Fittings, valves, and other components shall be delivered sealed, labeled, and kept sealed until prepared for installation. [NFPA 99:5.1.10.1.2, 5.1.10.1.3] 1310.4 Supply Source. Medical gas and medical vacuum systems shall be supplied from a source consisting of not less than two units -primary and secondary, e.g., a mani­fold consisting of two cylinder banks with not less than two 
cylinders in each bank; not less than two air compressors; 

or not less than two vacuum pumps. However, two supply 
pipelines are not required. 
1310.5 Health Care Organization Personnel. Health care organization personnel shall be permitted to install piping systems where the requirements of this chapter are met during installation. [NFPA 99:5.1.10.10.11.5] 
1310.6 Brazing Procedures. Brazing procedures and brazer performance for the installation of medical gas and vacuum piping shall be qualified in accordance with either Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or A WS B2.2, both as modified below. [NFPA 
99:5.1.1 0.10.12.1] 1310.6.1 Examination. Brazers shall be qualified by 


visual examination of the test coupon followed by sectioning. [NFPA 99:5.1.10.10.12.2] 
1310.6.2 Brazing Procedure Specification (BPS). 
The brazing procedure specification (BPS) shall address cleaning, joint clearance, overlap, internal purge gas flow rate, and filler metal. [NFP A 
99:5.1.10.10.12.3] 
1310.6.3 Documentation. The brazing procedure spec­
ification and the record of brazer performance qualifi­
cation shall document filler metal used, cleaning, joint 
clearance, overlap, internal purge gas, and flow rate 

during brazing of coupon, and the absence of internal 
oxidation in the completed coupon. [NFP A 



99:5.1.1 0.10.1 2.4] 
1310.6.4 Procedures. Brazing procedures qualified by 

a technically competent group or agency shall be permitted under the following conditions: 

(1) 	
The brazing procedure specification and the proce­dure qualification record meets the requirements of this code. 



(2) 
The employer obtains a copy of both the brazing procedure specification and the supporting qualifi­cation records from the group or agency and signs and dates these records, thereby accepting respon­sibility for the qualifications that were performed by the group or agency. 


(3) 
The employer qualifies not less than one brazer following each brazing procedure specification used. [NFPA 99:5.1.10.10.12.5] 


1310.6.5 Conditions of Acceptance. An employer shall be permitted to accept brazer qualification records of a previous employer under the following conditions: 
(1) 	
The brazer has been qualified following the same or an equivalent procedure that the new employer uses. 

(2) 	
The new employer obtains a copy of the record of brazer performance qualification tests from the previous employer and signs and dates these records, thereby accepting responsibility for the qualifications performed by the previous employer. [NFPA 99:5.1.10.10.12.6] 


1310.6.6 Qualifications. Performance qualifications of brazers shall remain in effect indefinitely unless the brazer does not braze with the qualified procedure for a period exceeding 6 months, or there is a specific reason to question the ability of the brazer. [NFPA 
99:5. 1.1 0. 1 0. 12.7] 

1311.0 Plan Review. 
1311.1 Plans and Specifications. Before a medical gas or 
medical vacuum system is installed or altered in a hospital,

APPENDIX A 
RECOMMENDED RULES FOR SIZING THE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM 
0 
Because of the variable conditions encountered, it is impractical to lay down definite detailed rules of procedure for determining the sizes of water supply pipes in an 
appendix, which shall necessarily be limited in length. For a more adequate understanding of the problems involved, refer to Water-Distributing Systems for Buildings, Report BMS 79 of the National Bureau of Standards; and Plumbing Manual, Report BMS 66, also published by the National Bureau of Standards. 


The following is a suggested order of procedure for sizing the water supply system. 
A 1.0 Preliminary Information. 
A 1.1 Daily Service Pressure. Obtain the necessary infor­

mation regarding the minimum daily service pressure in the area where the building is to be located. A 1.2 Water Meter. Where the building supply is to be 

0 
metered, obtain information regarding friction loss relative to the rate of flow for meters in the range of sizes likely to be used. Friction-loss data is capable of being obtained from most manufacturers of water meters. Friction losses for disk-type meters shall be permitted to be obtained from 
Chart A 1.2. 

A 1.3 Local Information. Obtain available local informa­
tion regarding the use of different kinds of pipe with 
respect both to durability and to decrease in capacity with 
length of service in the particular water supply. 

A 2.0 Demand Load. 
A 2.1 Supply Demand. Estimate the supply demand for 
the building main, the principal branches and risers of the 
system by totaling the fixture units on each, Table A 2.1, 

and then by reading the corresponding ordinate from Chart 
A 2.1 or Chart A 2.1(1), whichever is applicable. 
A 2.2 Continuous Supply Demand. Estimate continuous 
supply demands in gallons per minute (gpm) (Lis) for lawn 

sprinklers, air conditioners, etc., and add the sum to the 
total demand for fixtures. The result is the estimated supply 
demand of the building supply. 

A 3.0 Permissible Friction Loss. 
A 3.1 Residual Pressure. Decide what is the desirable 
minimum residual pressure that shall be maintained at the 
highest fixture in the supply system. Where the highest 
group of fixtures contains flushometer valves, the residual

For SI units: 1 inch = 25 nun, 1 pound-force per square inch= 6.8947 kPa, 1 gallon per minute= 0.06 Lis 

2013 CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE 

pressure for the group shall be not less than 15 pounds­force per square inch (psi) (103 kPa). For flush tank sup­plies, the available residual pressure shall be not less than 8 psi (55 kPa). 
A 3.2 Elevation. Determine the elevation of the highest fixture or group of fixtures above the water (street) main. Multiply this difference in elevation by 0.43. The result is the loss in static pressure in psi (kPa). 
A 3.3 Available Pressure. Subtract the sum of loss in static pressure and the residual pressure to be maintained at the highest fixture from the average minimum daily service pressure. The result will be the pressure available for fric­tion loss in the supply pipes, where no water meter is used. Where a meter is to be installed, the friction loss in the meter for the estimated maximum demand should also be subtracted from the service pressure to determine the pres­sure loss available for friction loss in the supply pipes. 

A 3.4 Developed Length. Determine the developed length of pipe from the water (street) main to the highest fixture. Where close estimates are desired, compute with the aid of Table A 3.4, the equivalent length of pipe for fittings in the line from the water (street) main to the highest fixture and add the sum to the developed length. The pressure available for friction loss in psi (kPa), divided by the developed lengths of pipe from the water (street) main to the highest fixture, times 100, will be the average permissible friction loss per 100 feet (30 480 mm) length of pipe. 
A 4.0 Size of Building Supply. A 4.1 Diameter. Knowing the permissible friction loss per 100 feet (30 480 mm) of pipe and the total demand, the diameter of the building supply pipe shall be permitted to be obtained from Chart A 4.1, Chart A 4.1(1), Chart A 4.1(2), or Chart A 4.1(3), whichever is applicable. The diameter of pipe on or next above the coordinate point cor­responding to the estimated total demand and the permissi­
ble friction loss will be the size needed up to the first branch from the building supply pipe. A 4.2 Copper and Brass Piping. Where copper tubing or 
brass pipe is to be used for the supply piping and where the character of the water is such that slight changes in the hydraulic characteristics are expected, Chart A 4.1 shall be permitted to be used. 
A 4.3 Hard Water. Chart A 4.1(1) shall be used for ferrous pipe with the most favorable water supply in regards to cor­rosion and caking. Where the water is hard or corrosive, Chart A 4.1(2) or Chart A 4.1(3) will be applicable. For extremely hard water, it will be advisable to make addition­al allowances for the reduction of capacity of hot-water lines in service. 
A 5.0 Size of Principal Branches and Risers. A 5.1 Size. The required size of branches and risers shall be permitted to be obtained in the same manner as the building supply, by obtaining the demand load on each branch or riser and using the permissible friction loss computed in 
Section A 3.0. A 5.2 Branches. Fixture branches to the building supply, where they are sized for the same permissible friction loss per 100 feet (30 480 mm) of pipe as the branches and risers to the highest level in the building, are capable of providing inadequate water supply to the upper floor of a building. This shall be controlled by one or more of the following: I 



(1) 	
Selecting the sizes of pipe for the different branches so that the total friction loss in each lower branch is approximately equal to the total loss in the riser, including both friction loss and loss in static pressure. 

(2) 
Throttling each such branch by means of a valve until the preceding balance is obtained. 


C)

(3) 	
Increasing the size of the building supply and risers above the minimum required to meet the maximum permissible friction loss. 

A 5.3 Water Closets. The size of branches and mains serving flushometer tanks shall be consistent with sizing procedures for flush tank water closets. 
A 6.0 General. A 6.1 Velocities. Velocities shall not exceed 10 feet per second (ftls) (3 m/s) or the maximum values given in the 
appropriate Installation Standard, except as otherwise approved by the Authority Having Jurisdiction. A 6.2 Pressure-Reducing Valves. Where a pressure-reduc­
ing valve is used in the building supply, the developed length of supply piping and the permissible friction loss shall be computed from the building side of the valve. 
A 6.3 Fittings. The allowances in Table A 3.4 for fittings are based on non-recessed threaded fittings. For recessed threaded fittings and streamlined soldered fittings, one-half of the allowances given in the table will be ample.

A 7.0 Sizing. 
A 7.1 Example. Assume an office building of four stories 
and basement; pressure on the building side of the pressure­
reducing valve of 55 psi (379 kPa) (after an allowance for 

reduced pressure falloff at peak demand); an elevation of highest fixture above the pressure-reducing valve of 45 feet (13 716 mm); a developed length of pipe from the pressure­
reducing valve to the most distant fixture of 200 feet ( 60 960 mm); and fixtures to be installed with flush valves for water closets and stall urinals as follows: 
Where the pipe material and water supply are such that Chart A 4.1(1) applies, the required diameter of the build­ing supply is 3'l2 inches (90 mm) and the required diameter of the branch to the hot-water heater is 1 'l2 inches (40 mm). 


The sizes of the various branches and risers shall be permitted to be determined in the same manner as the size of the building supply or the branch to the hot-water system, by estimating the demand for the riser or branch from Chart A 2.1 or Chart A 2.1(1) and applying the total demand estimate from the branch, riser, .or section thereof to the appropriate flowchart.

Allowing for 15 psi (103 kPa) at the highest fixture under the maximum demand of252 gallons per minute (15.88 Lis}, the pressure available ()for friction loss is found by the following: 
55 -[15 + (45 x 0.43)] = 20.65 psi (142.38 kPa) 
The allowable friction loss per 100 feet (30 480 mm) of pipe is therefore: 100 x 20.65..,. 200 = 10.32 psi (71.15 kPa)

APPENDIX B 
EXPLANATORY NOTES ON COMBINATION WASTE AND VENT SYSTEMS 


(See Section 91 0.0 for specific limitations) 
0 B 1.0 General Requirements. Combination waste and 
0 
vent systems, as outlined in Section 910.0 of this code, cover the horizontal wet venting of a series of traps by means of a common waste and vent pipe. Pipe sizes not less than two pipe sizes larger than those required for a conventional system are designed to maintain a wetted perimeter or flow line low enough in the waste pipe to 
allow adequate air movement in the upper portion, thus balancing the system. Sinks, lavatories, and other fixtures that rough in above the floor, shall not be permitted on a combination waste and vent system, which, at best, is merely an expedient designed to be used in locations where it would be structurally impractical to provide venting in the conventional manner. 
0 
Combination waste and vent systems are intended primarily for extensive floor or shower drain installations where separate venting is not practical, for floor sinks in markets, demonstration or work tables in school buildings, or for similar applications where the fixtures are not adjacent to walls or partitions. Due to its oversize characteristics, such a waste system is not self-scouring 
and, consequently, care shall be exercised as to the type of fixtures connected thereto and to the location of cleanouts. In view of its grease-producing potential, restaurant kitchen equipment shall not be connected to a combination waste and vent system. 
0 
B 2.0 Caution. Caution shall be exercised to exclude appurtenances delivering large quantities or surges of water (such as pumps, sand interceptors, etc.) from combination waste and vent systems in order that adequate venting will be maintained. Small fixtures with a waste-producing potential of less than 7Yz gallons per minute (gpm) (0.47 Lis) shall be permitted to be safely assigned a loading value of one unit. Long runs shall be laid at the minimum 
permissible slope in order to keep tailpieces as short as possible. Tailpieces shall not exceed 2 feet (610 mm) in length, which shall necessitate slopes up to 45 degrees 

0 
(0.79 rad) (see definition of horizontal pipe) on some branches. 
B 3.0 Pneumatics. It is essential that the pneumatics of such a system be properly engineered, as the air pressure within the line shall at all times balance that of outside atmosphere in order to prevent either trap seal loss or air locking between traps. Long mains shall be provided with additional relief vents located at intervals not exceeding 100 feet (30 480 mm). Each such relief vent shall equal not less than one-half of the inside cross-sectional area of the drain pipe served. 


2013 CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE 

B 4.0 Trap Sizes. Trap sizes are required to be equivalent to the branches they serve (two pipe sizes larger than normal), and tailpieces between fixtures or floor drains and such traps shall be reduced to normal size. 
B 5.0 Layout Drawings. Duplicate layout drawings of each such proposed piping system shall be presented to the Authority Having Jurisdiction and approval obtained before an installation is made. Complicated layouts shall be checked by qualified personnel. 
B 5.1 Example of Sizing. A floor drain normally requires a 2 inch (50 mm) trap and waste. On a combination waste and vent system, both trap and waste shall be increased two pipe sizes (through 2Yz inches and 3 inches) (65 mm and 80 mm), which would make the trap 3 inches (80 mm). Pipe sizes recognized for this purpose are 2 inches, 2Yz inches, 3 inches, 3Yz inches, 4 inches, 4Yz inches, 5 inches, 6 inches, etc. (50 mm, 65 mm, 80 mm, 90 mm, 100 mm, 115 mm, 125 mm, 150 mm, etc.). The tailpiece between the floor drain and its trap shall be 2 inches (50 mm) (or normal size) to ensure that the amount of wastewater entering the trap partially fills the waste branch. A 3 inch (80 mm) floor drain would thus require a 4 inch (100 mm) trap, and a 4 inch (100 mm) floor drain would require a 5 inch (125 mm) trap for the reasons previously stated. I 
WHERE IN DOUBT, CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL Authority Having Jurisdiction.

90 degree (1.57 rad) elbows in the vent system? (See 
Figure G 1.1) 

Solution: 
Table 51 0.1.2(2) shall be used to solve this problem 
because single-wall metal vent connectors are being used 
with a Type B vent, as follows: 

(1) 	Read down the first column in Table 510.1.2(2) until the row associated with a 10 foot (3048 mm) height and 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral is found. Read across this row until a vent capacity exceeding 120 000 Btulh (3 5 kW) is located in the shaded columns labeled NAT Max for draft hood-equipped appliances. In this case, a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter vent has a capacity of 122 000 Btulh (35.7 kW) and shall be permitted to be used for this application. 
the vent system, the maximum vent capacity listed in the tables shall be reduced by 10 percent. This implies that the 5 inch (127 mm) diameter vent has an adjusted capacity of 110 000 Btu!h (32 kW). In this case, the vent system shall be increased to 6 inches (152 mm) in diameter. See the following calculations: 
122 000 Btu/h (35.7 kW) x 0.90 110 000 Btu/h (32 
= 

kW) for 5 inch (127 mm) vent From Table 510.1.2(3), select 6 inch (152 mm) vent. 186 000 Btu!h (54.5 kW) x 0.90 167 000 Btu!h (49 
= 

kW) 
This figure is exceeding the required 120 000 Btulh (35 kW). Therefore, use a 6 inch (152 mm) vent and connector where three elbows are used.

FIGURE G 1.2 SINGLE FAN-ASSISTED APPLIANCE -EXAMPLE 2 


Solution: 
Table 510.1.2(2) refers to the use of single-wall metal vent connectors with Type B vent. In the first column find the row associated with a 30 foot (9144 mm) height and a 10 

APPENDIX G 
foot (3048 mm) lateral. Read across this row, looking at the FAN Min and FAN Max columns, to fmd that a 3 inch (76 mm) diameter single-wall metal vent connector is not rec­ommended. Moving to the next larger size single-wall con­nector 4 inch (1 02 mm), we fmd that a 4 inch (1 02 mm) diameter single-wall metal connector has a recommended maximum vent capacity of 144 000 Btu/h (42 kW). The 80 000 Btu/h (23.4 kW) fan-assisted appliance is outside this range, so the conclusion is that a single-wall metal connec­tor shall be used to vent the appliance. Table 510.1.2(2) shows the acceptable range of vent capacities for a 4 inch (102 mm) vent with 5 feet (1524 mm) of lateral to be between 72 000 Btu/h (21.1 kW) and 157 000 Btulh (46 kW). 
Where the appliance cannot be moved closer to the vertical vent, then a Type B vent shall be used as the con­nector material. In this case, Table 510.1.2(1) shows that, for a 30 foot (9144 mm) high vent with 10 feet (3048 mm) of lateral, the acceptable range of vent capacities for a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter vent attached to a fan-assisted appliance is between 37 000 Btulh (10.8 kW) and 150 000 Btulh (44 kW). 
G 1.3 Example 3: Interpolating Between Table Values. 
An installer has an 80 000 Btu/h (23.4 kW) input appliance with a 4 inch (1 02 mm) diameter draft hood outlet that needs to be vented into a 12 foot (3658 mm) high Type B vent. The vent connector has a 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral length and is also Type B vent. Is this appliance permitted to be vented using a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter vent? 
Solution: 
Table 510.1.2(1) is used in the case of an all Type B Vent system. However, since there is no entry in Table 510.1.2(1) for a height of 12 feet (3658 mm), interpolation shall be used. Read down the 4 inch (102 mm) diameter NAT Max column to the row associated with a 10 foot (3048 mm) height and 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral to find the capacity value of 77 000 Btu/h (22.6 kW). Read further down to the 15 foot (4572 mm) height, 5 foot (1524 mm) lateral row to find the capacity value of 87 000 Btulh (25.5 kW). The difference between the 15 foot (4572 mm) height capacity value and the 10 foot (3048 mm) height capacity value is 10 000 Btu/h (3 kW). The capacity for a vent system with a 12 foot (3658 mm) height is equal to the capacity for a 10 foot (3048 mm) height plus two-fifths of the difference between the 10 foot (3048 mm) and 15 foot (4572 mm) height values, or 77 000 Btu/h (22.6 kW) + 7's x 10 000 Btu/h (3 kW) 81 000 Btulh (23 .7 kW). Therefore, 
= 

a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter vent shall be used in the instal­lation. 
G 2.0 Examples Using Common Venting Tables. 
G 2.1 Example 4: Common Venting Two Draft Hood­
Equipped Appliances. A 35 000 Btu/h (10.3 kW) water 

heater is to be common vented with a 150 000 Btulh (44 kW) furnace, using a common vent with a total height of 30 feet (9144 mm). The connector rise is 2 feet (6 10 mm) for the water heater with a horizontal length of 4 feet (1219 mm). The connector rise for the furnace is 3 feet (914 mm) with a horizontal length of 8 feet (2438 mm). Assume single-wall metal connectors will be used with Type B vent. What size connectors and combined vent should be used in this installation? (See Figure G 2.1) 
Solution: Table 51 0.2(2) shall be used to size single-wall metal vent connectors attached to Type B vertical vents. In the vent connector capacity portion of Table 510.2(2), find the row associated with a 30 foot (9144 mm) vent height. For a 2 foot ( 610 mm) rise on the vent connector for the water heater, read the shaded columns for draft hood-equipped appliances to find that a 3 inch (76 mm) diameter vent con­nector has a capacity of37 000 Btu!h (10.8 kW). Therefore, 
a 3 inch (76 mm) single-wall metal vent connector shall be used with the water heater. For a draft hood-equipped furnace with a 3 foot (914 mm) rise, read across the row to find that a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter vent connector has a 
maximum capacity of 120 000 Btu/h (35 kW) (which is too small for the furnace), and a 6 inch (152 mm) diameter vent connector has a maximum vent capacity of 172 000 Btu/h (50 kW). Therefore, a 6 inch (152 mm) diameter vent con­nector shall be used with the 150 000 Btu/h ( 44 kW) furnace. Since both vent connector horizontal lengths are less than the maximum lengths listed in Section 510.2.1, the table values shall be used without adjustments. 
In the common vent capacity portion of Table 510.2(2), find the row associated with a 30 foot (9144 mm) vent height and read over to the NAT + NAT portion of the 6 inch (152 mm) diameter colunm to find a maximum com­bined capacity of 257 000 Btu/h (75 kW). Since the two appliances total 185 000 Btu!h (54 kW), a 6 inch (152 mm) common vent shall be used.

HEATER WITH A FAN-ASSISTED FURNACE INTO A TYPE B 
DOUBLE-WALL COMMON VENT -EXAMPLE 5(a) 

Solution [see Table 510.2(2)]: 
Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Since the water heater vent connector horizontal length of 4 feet (1219 mm) is less than the maximum value listed in Table 51 0.2(2), the venting table values shall be used without adjustment. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 510.2(2), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm) and read across the 2 feet (610 mm) Connector Rise (R) row to the first Btu/h rating in the NAT Max colunm that is equal to or exceeding the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3 inch (76 mm) vent connector has a maximum input rating of 37 000 Btu/h (10.8 kW). Although this rating is exceeding the water heater input rating, a 3 inch (76 mm) vent connector is prohibited by Section 510.2.20. A 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector has a maximum input rating of 67 000 Btu/h 
(19.6 kW) and is equal to the draft hood outlet diameter. A 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector is selected. Since the water

input rating restrictions. 
EQUIVALENTS*

Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 510.2(2), read down the Total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm) and across the 3 feet (914 mm) Connector Rise (R) row. Since the furnace has a fan-assisted combustion system, find the 
first FAN Max column with a Btu/h rating exceeding the furnace input rating. The 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector has a maximum input rating of 119 000 Btu/h (34.9 kW) and a minimum input rating of 85 000 Btu/h (24.9 kW). 

CJ 
The 100 000 Btu/h (29 kW) furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4 inch (102 mm) connector shall be permitted. Since the furnace vent connector hori­zontal length of6 feet (1829 mm) is less than the maximum value listed in Section 510.2.1, the venting table values shall be used without adjustment. Where the furnace had an input rating of 80 000 Btu/h (23 .4 kW), then a Type B vent connector shall be needed in order to meet the minimum capacity limit. [See Table 510.2(1)] 
Common Vent Diameter. The total input to the common vent is 135 000 Btu/h (40 kW). Using the Common Vent Capacity portion of Table 510.2(2), read down the Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9 144 mm) and across this row to find the smallest vent diameter in the FAN + NAT column that has a Btu/h rating equal to or exceeding 135 000 Btu/h (40 kW). The 4 inch (102 mm) 
common vent has a capacity of 132 000 Btu/h (39 kW) and the 5 inch (127 mm) common vent has a capacity of 202 000 Btu/h (59 kW). Therefore, the 5 inch (127 mm) common vent shall be used in this example. 
Summary: In this example, the installer shall use a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter, single-wall metal vent connector for the water heater and a 4 inch (102 mm) diameter, single­wall metal vent connector for the furnace. The common vent shall be a 5 inch (127 mm) diameter Type B vent.

G 2.3 Example 5(b ): Common Venting into an Interior Masonry Chimney. In this case, the water heater and fan­assisted furnace of Example 5(a) are to be common-vented into a clay-tile-lined masonry chimney with a 30 foot (9144 mm) height. The chimney is not exposed to the outdoors below the roof line. The internal dimensions of the clay tile liner are nominally 8 inches (203 mm) by 12 inches (305 mm). Assuming the same vent connector heights, laterals, and materials found in Example 5(a), what are the recom­mended vent connector diameters, and is this an acceptable 
installation? 

Solution: Table 510.2(4) is used to size common venting installations ( \ involving single-wall connectors into masonry chimneys. Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 510.2(4), Vent Connector Capacity, read down the Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm), and read across 
2013 CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE 




the 2 feet (6 10 mm) Connector Rise (R) row to the first Btu/h rating in the NAT Max column that is equal to or exceeding the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3 inch (76 mm) vent connector has a maximum input of 31 000 Btu/h (9 kW), while a 4 inch (1 02 mm) vent con­nector has a maximum input of 57 000 Btu!h (16.7 kW). A 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector shall be used. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using the Vent Connector Capacity portion of Table 510.2(4), read down the total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm) and across the 3 feet (914 mm) Connector Rise (R) row. Because the furnace has a fan-assisted combustion system, find the first FAN Max column with a Btu/h rating exceed­ing the furnace input rating. The 4 inch (102 mm) vent con­nector has a maximum input rating of 127 000 Btu/h (37 kW) and a minimum input rating of 95 000 Btu/h (27.8 kW). The 100 000 Btulh (29 kW) furnace in this :example falls within this range, so a 4 inch (102 mm) connector shall be permitted. 
Masonry Chimney. From Table G 2.3, the equivalent area for a nominal liner size of 8 inches (203 mm) by 12 inches (305 mm) is 63.6 square inches (0.041 m2). Using Table 510.2(4), Common Vent Capacity, read down the FAN + NAT column under the Minimum Internal Area of Chimney value of 63 to the row for 30 foot (9144 mm) height to find a capacity value of 739 000 Btu/h (217 kW). The combined input rating of the furnace and water heater, 135 000 Btu/h (40 kW), is less than the table value so this is an acceptable installation. 
Section 510.2.16 requires the common vent area to not exceed seven times the smallest listed appliance catego­rized vent area, flue collar area, or draft hood outlet area. Both appliances in this installation have 4 inch (1 02 mm) diameter outlets. From Table G 2.3, the equivalent area for an inside diameter of 4 inches (102 mm) is 12.2 square inches (0.008 m2). Seven times 12.2 equals 85.4, which is exceeding 63.6, so this configuration is acceptable. 
G 2.4 Example 5(c): Common Venting into an Exterior Masonry Chimney. In this case, the water heater and fan­assisted furnace of Examples 5(a) and 5(b) are to be common-vented into an exterior masonry chimney. The chimney height, clay-tile-liner dimensions, and vent con­nector heights and laterals are the same as in Example 5(b ). This system is being installed in Charlotte, North Carolina. Does this exterior masonry chimney need to be relined? Where so, what corrugated metallic liner size is recom­mended? What vent connector diameters are recom­mended? [See Table G 2.3 and Figure 510.1.2(6)] 
Solution: According to Section 510.2.19, Type B vent connec­tors are required to be used with exterior masonry chim­neys. Use Table 510.2(8) and Table 510.2(9) to size FAN+NAT common venting installations involving Type­B double-wall connectors into exterior masonry chimneys. 


The local 99 percent winter design temperature needed to use Table 510.2(8) and Table 510.2(9) shall be found in the ASHRAE Handbook -Fundamentals. For Charlotte, North Carolina, this design temperature is 19°F (-7.2°C). 


Chimney Liner Requirement. As in Example 5(b), use the 63 square inches (0.04 m2) column of Table 510.2(8) to the 30 foot (9144 mm) height row to find that the combined 
0

appliance maximum input is 747 000 Btulh (218.9 kW). The combined input rating of the appliance in this installa­tion, 135 000 Btu/h ( 40 kW), is less than the maximum value, so this criterion is satisfied. Table 510.2(9), at a 19°F (-7 .2°C) design temperature, and at the same vent height and internal area used earlier, shows that the minimum

allowable input rating of a space-heating appliance is 470 000 Btulh (137.7 kW). The furnace input rating of 100 000 Btu!h (29 kW) is less than this minimum yalue. So this cri­terioh is not satisfied, and an alternativ
e venting esign shaWbe used, such as a Type B vent shown in Example 5(a) r a listed chimney liner system shown in the rfst of the example. 
According to Section 510.2.18, Table 510.2(1) or Table 510.2(2) are used for sizing corrugated metallic liners in masonry chimneys, with the maximum common vent capacities reduced by 20 percent. This example will be, con­tinued assuming Type B vent connectors. 
Water Heater Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 510.2(1) Connector Capacity, read down the total Vent

Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm), and read across the 2 feet (610 mm) Connector Rise (R) row to the first 
Btu/hom rating in the NAT Max column that is equal to or exceeding the water heater input rating. The table shows that a 3 inch (76 mm) vent connector has a maximum capacity of39 000 Btu/h (11.4 kW). Although this rating is exceeding the water heater input rating, a 3 inch (76 mm) vent connector is prohibited by Section 510.2.20. A 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector has a maximum input rating of 70 000 Btu/h (20.5 kW) and is equal to the draft hood outlet diameter. A 4 inch (102 mm) vent connector is selected. 
Furnace Vent Connector Diameter. Using Table 510.2(1), Vent Connector Capacity, read down the total 
0 Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9144 mm), and read across the 3 feet (914 mm) Connector Rise (R) row to the first Btu/h rating in the FAN MAX column that is equal to or exceeding the furnace input rating. The 100 000 Btu/h (29 kW) furnace in this example falls within this range, so a 4 inch (102 mm) connector shall be permitted. 


Chimney Liner Diameter. The total input to the common vent is 135 000 Btu/h (40 kW). Using the Common Vent Capacity portion of Table 510.2(1), read down the total Vent Height (H) column to 30 feet (9 144 mm) and across this row to fmd the smallest vent diameter in the FAN + NAT column that has a Btu/h rating exceed­ing 135 000 Btu/h (40 kW). The 4 inch (102 mm) common vent has a capacity of 138 000 Btu/h (40.4 kW). Reducing 

2013 CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE 


APPENDIX G 

the maximum capacity by 20 percent results in a maximum 
capacity for a 4 inch (102 mm) corrugated liner of 110 000 Btu/h (32 kW), less than the total input of 135 000 Btulh (40 kW). So a larger liner is needed. The 5 inch (127 mm) common vent capacity listed in Table 510.2(1) is 210 000 Btu/h (62 kW), and after reducing by 20 percent is 168 000 Btulh (49.2 kW). Therefore, a 5 inch (127 mm) corrugated metal liner shall be used in this example. 
Single Wall Connectors. Once it has been established that relining the chimney is necessary, Type B double-wall vent connectors are not specifically required. This example shall be permitted to be redone using Table 510.2(2) for single-wall vent connectors. For this case, the vent connec­tor and liner diameters would be the same as found for Type B double-wall connectors.

(J 






H 1.0 Private Sewage Disposal. H 1.1 General Requirements. Where permitted by Section 713.0, the building sewer shall be permitted to be connect­ed to a private sewage disposal system in accordance with the provisions of this appendix. The type of system shall be determined on the basis of location, soil porosity, and groundwater level, and shall be designed to receive all sewage from the property. The system, except as otherwise approved, shall consist of a septic tank with effluent dis­charging into a subsurface disposal field, into one or more seepage pits, or into a combination of subsurface disposal field and seepage pits. The Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be permitted to grant exceptions to the provisions of this appendix for permitted structures that have been destroyed due to fire or natural disaster and that cannot be 
reconstructed in compliance with these provisions provided that such exceptions are the minimum necessary. H 1.2 Quantity and Quality. Where the quantity or quality 
of the sewage is such that the above system cannot be expected to function satisfactorily for commercial, agricul­tural, and industrial plumbing systems; for installations where appreciable amounts of industrial or indigestible wastes are produced; for occupancies producing abnormal quantities of sewage or liquid waste; or where grease inter­ceptors are required by other parts of this code, the method of sewage treatment and disposal shall be first approved by the Authority Having Jurisdiction. Special sewage disposal systems for minor, limited, or temporary uses shall be first approved by the Authority Having Jurisdiction. 
H 1.3 Septic Tank and Disposal Field Systems. Disposal systems shall be designed to utilize the most porous or absorptive portions of the soil formation. Where the groundwater level extends to within 12 feet (3658 mm) or less of the ground surface or where the upper soil is porous and the underlying stratum is rock or impervious soil, a septic tank and disposal field system shall be installed. 
H 1.4 Flood Hazard Areas. Disposal systems shall be 
located outside of flood hazard areas. Exception: Where suitable sites outside of flood hazard areas are not available, disposal systems shall be permitted to be located in flood hazard areas on sites where the effects of inundation under conditions of the design flood are minimized. 
H 1.5 Design. Private sewage disposal systems shall be so designed that additional seepage pits or subsurface drain fields, equivalent to not less than 100 percent of the required original system, shall be permitted to be installed where the original system cannot absorb all the sewage. No division of the lot or erection of structures on the lot shall be made where such division or structure impairs the use­fulness of the 100 percent expansion area. 
2013 CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE 



H 1.6 Capacity. No property shall be improved in excess of its capacity to properly absorb sewage effluent by the means provided in this code. 
Exception: The Authority Having Jurisdiction shall be per­
mitted to, at its discretion, approve an alternate system. H 1.7 Location. No private sewage disposal system, or part thereof, shall be located in any lot other than the lot that is the site of the building or structure served by such private sewage disposal system, nor shall any private sewage dis­posal system or part thereof be located at any point having less than the minimum distances indicated in Table H 1.7. 
Nothing contained in this code shall be construed to prohibit the use of all or part of an abutting lot to provide additional space for a private sewage disposal system or part thereof where proper cause, transfer of ownership, or change of boundary not in violation of other requirements has been first established to the satisfaction of the Authority Having Jurisdiction. The instrument recording such action shall constitute an agreement with the Authority Having Jurisdiction, which shall clearly state and show that the areas so joined or used shall be maintained as a unit during the time they are so used. Such agreement shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder as part of the condi­tions of ownership of said properties and shall be binding on heirs, successors, and assigns to such properties. A copy of the instrument recording such proceedings shall be filed with the Authority Having Jurisdiction. 
H 1.8 Building Permit. Where there is insufficient lot area or improper soil conditions for sewage disposal for the building or land use proposed, . and the Authority Having Jurisdiction so finds, no building permit shall be issued and no private sewage disposal shall be permitted. Where space or soil conditions are critical, no building permit shall be issued until engineering data and test reports satisfactory to the Authority Having Jurisdiction have been submitted and approved. 
H 1.9 Additional Requirements. Nothing contained in this appendix shall be construed to prevent the Authority Having Jurisdiction from requiring compliance with addi­tional requirements than those contained herein, where such additional requirements are essential to maintain a safe and sanitary condition. 
H 1.10 Alternate Systems. Alternate systems shall be per­mitted to be used by special permission of the Authority Having Jurisdiction after being satisfied of their adequacy. This authorization is based on extensive field and test data from conditions similar to those at the proposed site, or require such additional data as necessary to provide assur­ance that the alternate system will produce continuous and long-range results at the proposed site, not less than equiva­lent to systems which are specifically authorized.

2.2 	Type of Joints. 
2.2.1 	General Information. Copper tube and fit­tings may be joined in a number of ways, depending on the purpose of the system. Soldering and brazing with capillary fittings are the methods used most. 
The American Welding Society (A WS) 
defines soldering as a joining process which 
takes place below 840°F ( 449°C) and brazing 
as a similar process which occurs above 
840°F ( 449°C) but below the melting point of 
the base metals. In actual practice for copper 
systems, most soldering is done at tempera­
tures from about 350°F (177°C) to 550°F 
(288°C), while most brazing is done at tem­
peratures ranging from 1100°F (593°C) to 
1500°F (816°C). The choice between solder­
ing or brazing will generally depend on oper­
ating conditions. Solder joints are generally 
used where the service temperature does not 
exceed 250°F (121 °C), while brazed joints are 
used where greater tensile strength is required 
to resist vibration, or pressure or temperature 
cycling, or where system temperatures are as 
high as 350°F (177°C). Although brazed 
joints offer higher joint strength in general, 
the annealing of the tube and fitting which 
results from the higher heat used in the 
brazing process can cause the rated pressure 
of the system to be less than that of a soldered 
joint. This fact should also be considered in 
choosing which joining process to use. 
Mechanical joints are used frequently for some underground connections, for joints 
2.2.2 

2.2.2.1 
2.2.3 
where the use of heat is impractical and for joints that may have to be disconnected from time to time. [UPC 605.3] 
Fittings for Soldered, Brazed, and Mechanical Joints. Cast fittings are available in all standard tube sizes and in a wide variety of types to cover needs for plumbing. They can be either soldered or brazed, although brazing cast fittings requires care. Wrought copper pressure fittings are also available over a wide range of sizes and types. These, too, can be joined by either soldering or brazing and wrought fittings are preferred where brazing is the joining method. Otherwise, the choice between cast and wrought fittings is largely a matter of the user's preference and availability. According to the American Welding Society, the strength of a brazed joint will meet or exceed that of the tube and fitting being joined when the joint overlap and the depth of the filler metal penetration is a minimum of three times the thickness of the thinner base metals (tube or fitting) and a well-developed fillet (cap) is present. The strength of a brazed copper tube joint does not vary much with different filler metals but depends on maintaining the proper clearance between the outside of the tube and the socket (cup) of the fitting. Copper tube and solder­type pressure fittings are accurately made for each other, and the tolerances permitted for each assure the capillary space will be within the limits necessary for a joint of satisfactory strength. However, the depths of the socket are considerable deeper than the three times required by A WS. There are standards avail­able for the manufacture of fittings made specifically for brazing, these include ASME B 16.50 and MSS SP 73. When fittings are made to these standards, they cannot be sol­dered. They must be brazed. 
Mechanical Joints. Flared-tube fittings provide metal-to-metal contact similar to ground joint unions; both can be easily taken apart and reassembled. Grooved end mechani­cal fittings are also available in sizes 2-inches to 6-inches. Mechanical joint fittings are espe­cially useful where residual water cannot be removed from the tube and soldering is diffi­cult. Mechanical joints may be required where a fire hazard exists and the use of a torch to make soldered or brazed joints is not allowed. Also, soldering under wet conditions can be very difficult and mechanical joints may be preferred under such circumstances. [UPC 605.3.3] 
Solders. Most solders referenced in ASTM B 32 can be used to join copper tube and fittings in potable water systems.

2.2.4 


Note: Users of the Uniform Plumbing Code are reminded that provisions of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986 (SDWA), which all must obey, forbid the use of solder which contains in excess of 0.2% of lead, in potable water systems. The provisions of the act are incorporated in all ordinances, statutes, state and municipal regulations by reference and by operation oflaw. [UPC 605.3.4] 
The selection of a solder depends on the oper­ating pressure and temperature of the system. Consideration should also be given to the stresses on the joint caused by thermal expan­sion and contraction. However, stresses due to temperature changes should not be significant in two commonly encountered cases: when tube lengths are short, or when expansion loops are used in long tube runs. 

Solder is generally used in wire form, but paste-type solders are also available. These 2.3 are finely granulated solders in suspension in 
2.3.1 
a paste flux. These solder/flux pastes must meet the requirements of ASTM B 813. When using paste-type solders, observe these four rules: 
1. 	
Wire solder must be applied in addition to the paste to fill the voids and assist in displacing the flux, otherwise the sur­faces may be well "tinned" and yet there may not be a good joint with a continu­ous bond. Use the same type of solder (e.g., 50-50 or 95-5) as that used in the paste. 

2. 	
The paste mixture must be thoroughly stirred if it has been standing in the can for more than a very short time, as the solder has a tendency to settle rapidly to the bottom. 

3. 	
The flux cannot be depended on to clean the tube. Cleaning should be done manu­ally as is recommended for any other flux and solder. 

4. 
Remove any excess flux. Solders are available that contain small amounts of silver or other additives to impart 



2.3.2
special properties. Such solders may require special fluxes. The manufacturer's recom­

mendations should be consulted regarding proper procedures and fluxes for such solders and about the expected properties. 
Soldering Flux. The functions of the solder­ing flux are to remove residual traces of oxides, to promote wetting and to protect the surfaces to be soldered from oxidation during heating. The flux should be applied to clean surfaces and only enough should be used to lightly coat the areas to be joined. 


15 3 
An oxide film may reform quickly on copper after it has been cleaned. Therefore, the flux should be applied as soon as possible after cleaning. 
CAUTION 

Careless workmanship, especially during flux applications, can result in corrosion of the tube long after the system has been installed. If excessive flux is used, the residue inside the tube can cause corrosion. In an extreme case, such residual flux can actually lead to perfora­tion through the tube wall causing leakage. To guard against this danger, it is important (1) to choose a flux that is manufactured to ASTM B 813, and (2) to use only the minimum amount actually needed to make the joint. 
Solder Joints. 

Soldering and brazing both involve basic steps, based on ASTM Standard Practice B 828, which must be executed with care and craftsmanship. The steps are: 
(1) 
Measuring 

(2) 
Cutting 

(3) 
Reaming 

(4) 
Cleaning 

(5) 
Fluxing 

(
6) Assembly and support 

(7) 
Heating 

(8) 
Applying the filler metal 

(9) 
Cooling and cleaning 




Each step contributes to a strong, dependable joint. Measuring. Measuring the length of each 
tube segment must be accurate. Inaccuracy can compromise joint quality. If the tube is too short it will not reach all the way into the socket of the fitting and a proper joint cannot be made. If the tube segment is too long there is a danger of cocking the tube in the fitting and putting strain on the system which could affect service life. 
Cutting. Once the tube is measured, it can be cut. Cutting can be accomplished in a number of different ways to produce a satisfactory square end. The tube can be cut with a disc­type tube cutter, a hacksaw, an abrasive wheel, or with a stationary or portable handsaw. Care must be taken that the tube is not deformed while being cut. Regardless of the method, the cut must be square with the run of the tube so that the tube will seat prop­erly in the fitting socket.

Sizing, Velocity. To avoid excess system noise and the possibility of erosion-corrosion, flow through copper tube systems should not exceed velocities of 8 feet per second for cold water and 5 feet per second in hot water up to approximately 140°F (60°C) [UPC 610.0] 
In systems where water temperatures rou­tinely exceed 140°F (60°C), lower velocities such as 2 to 3 feet per second should not be exceeded. In addition, where 1/2 inch and smaller tube sizes are used, to guard against localized high velocity turbulence due to pos­sible faulty workmanship (e.g. burrs at tube ends which were not properly removed) or unusually numerous, abrupt changes in flow direction, lower velocities should be consid­ered. 
Due to constant circulation and elevated water temperatures, particular attention should be paid to velocities in circulation hot water systems. Both the supply and return piping should be sized such that the maximum veloc­ity does not exceed the above recommenda­tions. Care should be taken to ensure that the circulating pump is not oversized and the return piping is not undersized, both common occurrences in installed copper piping systems. 
General Information. 
It is not possible to cover all the variables of a plumbing system; however, the following information may prove helpful: 
Expansion Loops -Copper tube, like all piping materials, expands and contracts with temperature changes. Therefore, in a copper tube system subjected to excessive temperature changes, the line tends to buckle or bend when it expands unless compensation is built into the system. Severe stresses on the joints may also occur. Such stresses, buckles, or bends are pre­vented by the use of expansion joints or by installing offsets, "U" bends, coil loops, or similar arrangements in the tube assembly. These specially shaped tube segments take up expansion and contraction without excessive stress. The expansion of a length of copper tube may be calculated from the formula: 
Temperature Rise COF) x Length (feet) x 12 (inches per foot) x Expansion Coefficient (in. per in. per °F) 
= 
Expansion (inches), or 

Temperature Rise (0C) x Length (meter) x 
1000 (mm per meter) x 
Expansion Coefficient (mm per mm per oq = 
Expansion (mm). 


IS 3 
Calculations for expansion and contraction should be based on the average coefficient of expansion of copper, which is 0.0000094 per °F (1.692 X 10-5 per °C), between 70°F (21 °C) and 212°F (100°C). For example, the expansion of each 100 feet (3048 mm) of 
length of any size tube heated from room tem­perature (70°F) (21 °C) to 170°F (77°C) (a 100°F (38°C) rise) is 1.128 inches (28.7 mm). 
100° X 100 ft X 12 in./ft X 
0.0000094 in./in./°F = 1.128 in., or 55.6° X 30.48 m X 1000 mm/m X 1.692 X 10-5 mm/mm/°C = 28.7 mm 

3.2 	Tube Supports -See Table 313.1 and Section 313.0 in the Uniform Plumbing Code. 
3.3 	Bending. 
3.3.1 	Copper tube, properly bent, will not collapse on the outside of the bend and will not buckle on the inside of the bend. Tests demonstrate that the bursting strength of a bent copper tube can be greater than it was before bending. Because copper is readily formed, expansion loops and other bends necessary in an assembly are quickly and simply made if the proper method and equipment are used. 
Simple hand tools employing mandrels, dies, forms, and fillers, or power-operated bending machines are used. 
Both annealed tube and bending-temper tube can be bent with hand benders. The proper size bender for each size tube must be used. Usually the size of the tool corresponds to the nominal outside diameter of the tube, not the standard tube size. For a guide to the typical bend radii, see the following bending guide for copper tube.

201 3 CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE 

2.5.3.2 	Safety Precautions. Prolonged breathing of solvent vapors should be avoided. When pipe and fittings are being joined in partially enclosed areas, a ventilating device should be used in such a manner to minimize the entry of vapors into the breathing areas. 
2.5.3.3 	Solvent cements should be kept away from all sources of ignition, heat, sparks and open flame. 
2.5.3.4 	Containers for solvent cements should be kept tightly closed except when the cement is being used. 
2.5.3.5 	All rags and other materials used for mopping up spills should be kept in a safety waste receptacle which should be emptied daily. 
2.5.3.6 	Most of the solvents used in ABS pipe cements can be considered eye irritants and contact with the eye should be avoided for it may cause eye injury. Proper eye protection and the use of chemical goggles or face shields is advisable where the possibility of splashing exists in handling solvent cements. In case of eye contact, flush with plenty of water for 15 minutes and call a physician immediately. 
2.5.3.7 	Repeated contact with the skin should be 
2.5.4
avoided. Proper gloves impervious to and unaffected by the solvents should be worn when frequent contact with the skin is likely. Application of the solvents or solvent cements with rags and bare hand is not recommended. Brushes and other suitable applicators can be used effectively for applying the solvent cement, thus avoiding skin contact. In the event of excessive contact, remove contami­nated clothing and wash skin with soap and water. 
Step 1 	Cut pipe square with hand saw and miter box, mechanical cut­off saw, or tube cutter designed for plastic. 
Step 2 	Ream inside and chamfer outside of pipe (to eliminate all burrs). 
Step 3 	Clean all dirt, moisture, and grease from pipe and socket. Use a clean, dry rag. 
2.5.5
Step 4 	Check dry fit of pipe in fitting. Pipe should enter fitting socket 2.5.5.1 from 'i3 to % depth of socket. 
Step 5 	Apply a light coat of ABS solvent cement to inside of socket using straight outward strokes (to keep excess solvent 2.6 out of socket). This is also to prevent solvent cement damage to pipe. For loose fits, apply a second coat of solvent cement. Time is important at this stage. See Section 2.5.2.4. 




Step 6 	While both the inside socket surface and the outside surface of the pipe are SOFT and WET with solvent cement, forcefully bottom the pipe in the socket, 
CJ 
giving the pipe a one-quarter tum, if possible. The pipe must go to the bottom of the socket. 
Step 7 	Hold the joint together until tight (partial set). 
CJ
Step 8 	Wipe excess cement from the pipe. A properly made joint will normally show a bead around its entire perimeter. Any gaps may indicate insufficient cement or the use of light bodied cement on larger diameters where heavy bodied cement should have been used. 
Step 9 	The system shall not be tested until the joints have cured (set) at least as long as recommended by the manufacturer. 
Threaded Joints. 
Threads on iron pipe size (IPS) pipe and fit­tings shall be standards listed in Table 14-1. Threads on tubing shall be approved types. Threads on plastic pipe shall be factory cut or molded. Threaded plastic pipe shall be Schedule 80 minimum wall thickness. Tubing threads shall conform to fine tubing thread standards. When a pipe joint material is used, it shall be applied only on male threads and such materials shall be approved types, insolu­ble in water and nontoxic. Cleanout plugs and caps shall be lubricated with water-insoluble, non-hardening material or tape. Only listed thread tape or thread lubricants and sealants specifically intended for use with plastics shall be used on plastic threads. Conventional pipe thread compounds, putty, linseed oil base products, and unknown lubricants and sealants shall not be used on plastic threads. [UPC

Protection of Piping. Storage. Unprotected pipe should not be stored in direct sunlight. The pipe shall be stored in a way to protect it from mechanical damage (slitting, puncturing, etc.). 


2.3.2 	Thermal Expansion. The pipe shall be 2.5.2.2 snaked in the trench bottom with enough slack to provide for thermal expansion and contraction. The normal slack created by residual coiling is generally sufficient for this purpose. If, however, the pipe has been allowed to straighten before it is placed in the trench, six (6) inches (152 mm) per one hundred (100) feet (30,480 mm) of length shall be allowed for this purpose. [UPC 312.0] 
2.3.3 	Exposed Piping. Vertical piping may extend a maximum of twenty-four (24) inches (6 10 mm) above grade when located on the exte­rior of the building or structure and protected from mechanical damage to the satisfaction of the Administrative Authority. Where exposed to sunlight, the pipe shall be wrapped with at 2.5.3 least 0.040 in. (1.02 mm) of tape. 
2.4 	Trenching and Cover. Trench bottoms shall be uniformly graded and shall be of either undisturbed soil or shall consist of a layer or 2.6 layers of compacted backfill so that minimum

Handling (to maintain effectiveness). 
Package solvent cement in containers no larger than 1 quart (1 liter). Keep solvent cement can closed and in the shade when not in use. Keep applicator submerged in solvent cement between applications. When solvent cement becomes thicker, THROW IT A WAY. Solvent cement shall NOT be thinned. 
Size of Applicator. Applicator should be about one half the pipe diameter. Do not use small applicator on large pipes. 
Primers. All solvent cement PVC joints shall be made using a listed primer in compliance with ASTM F 656 and as specified in Section 
605.13.2 ofthe UPC. Application. Solvent cement shall be applied deliberately, but without delay (two men may be needed to make large joints). Use special 
care when temperature is over 100°F (38°C) or humidity is over 60%. 

Procedure. 
Note: Do not take SHORT CUTS. Most fail­
ures are caused by short cuts. DON'T TAKE 
A CHANCE. 

Safety Requirements and Precautions1• 
General. Solvents contained in PVC plastic 
pipe cements are classified as airborne con­
taminants and flammable and combustible 
liquids. Precautions listed in this appendix 

should be followed to avoid injury to person­
nel and the hazard of fire. 
Safety Precautions. Prolonged breathing of 

solvent vapors should be avoided. When pipe 
and fittings are being joined in partially 
enclosed areas, a ventilating device should be 
used in such a manner to minimize the entry 
of vapors into the breathing areas. 

Solvent cements should be kept away from all 
sources of ignition, heat, sparks, and open 
flame. 

Containers for solvent cements should be kept 
tightly closed except when the cement is 
being used. 

All rags and other materials used for mopping 
up spills should be kept in a safety waste 
receptacle which should be emptied daily.

Example for Table 2: 
For a pressure of 150 psi (1,033.5 kPa) on a 4 inch (102 mm) tee, Table 2 indicates 1,620 pounds (7,209 N) for 100 psi (689 kPa). Therefore, total thrust for 150 psi (1033.5 kPa) will equal 1 \h times 1620 pounds (7,209 N) for a total thrust of 2430 pounds (10,810 N). 

To determine the bearing area of thrust blocks, refer to Table 4 for the safe bearing load of the soil and divide the total thrust by this safe bearing load.

2.1.4.1 	Primer shall be purple. 
2.2 
Workmanship. 

2.2.1 	Alignment. All piping systems components shall be aligned properly without strain. Pipe shall not be bent or pulled into position. Vertical piping shall be maintained in straight alignment between floors with midstory guides. 










1 Although referenced in this standard, some of the fittings shown in the standard are not acceptable under the Uniform Plumbing Code. 2 It is common practice to dual mark Schedule 40 DWV and potable water piping in which compliance with each applicable standard is met. 




Pipe and fittings shall be so positioned that 2.3.5 identifying markings shall be readily visible for inspection. [UPC 309.0] 
Protection of Piping. 

2.3.1 	Storage. Pipe and fittings should not be stored in direct sunlight; however, exposure to sunlight during normal construction periods is not considered harmful. Pipe shall be stored in such a manner as to prevent sagging or bending. 
2.3.2 	Expansion and Contraction. 
Thermal expansion and contraction of plastic drain waste and vent systems shall be taken into consideration. Thermal expansion and con­traction may be controlled by several methods : offset, expansion joints, or restraints. 2.4 

Regardless of method utilized, certain condi­tions shall be met: 
(a) 	
Support, but do not rigidly restrain piping at changes of direction. 

(b) 
Do not anchor pipe rigidly in walls. 

(c) 	
Holes through framing members must be adequately sized to allow for free move­ment. 





DWV installation with frequent changes in 
2.5.0
direction will compensate for thermal expan­
sion and contraction. 2.5.1 Expansion joints may be utilized in vertical straight runs in excess of 30 feet (9,144 mm)provided they are installed per manufacturer's installation instructions. 
Except piping buried below ground, horizon­2.5.2 tal and vertical piping should be installed with restraint fittings or a minimum . of 24 inches (610 mm) 45° offset every 30 feet (9,144 mm). Thermal expansion for installation subject to temperature changes may be deter­mined from Table 1. The linear expansion shown. is independent of the diameter of the pipe. [UPC 312.0] 

2.3.3 	Exposed Piping. Piping shall not be exposed 
to direct sunlight. 
Exception: Vent piping through roof. 
Plumbing vents through roof, exposed to sun­
light, shall be protected by water base syn­
thetic latex paints. 

Adequate support shall be provided where PVC piping is exposed to wind, snow, and ice

(a) 	
4 quarts (3.8 liters) of water mixed with 5 quarts (4.8 liters) of glycerol 

(b) 	
21h lbs. (1.1 kg) of magnesium chloride dissolved in one (1) gallon (3.8 liters) of water 

(c) 	
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) oftable salt dissolved in 


one (1) gallon (3.8 liters) ofwater. The salt solutions are effective to approxi­mately l0°F (-l2°C). If lower temperatures are anticipated, the pipe should be drained or the glycerol solution should be used. [UPC 312.6] 
Piping Installed in Fire Resistive 
Construction. Where piping is installed and 
penetrates required fire resistive construction, 
the fire resistive integrity of the construction 
shall be as required by the Administrative 
Authority, or when not established by the 
Building Code, by qualified testing methods 
approved by the Administrative Authority. 
Approval shall be obtained prior to installing 
any such piping. [UPC 312. 7] 

Hangers and Supports. 
Abrasion. Hangers and straps shall not com­
press, distort, cut, or abrade the piping and 
shall allow free movement of pipe. Pipe, 

exposed to damage by sharp surfaces, shall be 
protected. [UPC 313.0] 
Support. Support all horizontal piping at 

intervals of not more than four (4) feet (1,219 
mm), at end of branches, and at change of 
direction or elevation. Supports shall allow 
free movement, but shall restrict upward 
movement of lateral runs so as not to create 
reverse grade. Vertical piping shall be sup­
ported at each story or floor level. Alignment 
of vertical piping shall be maintained between 
floors with the use of a mid-story guide. 
Support trap arms in excess of three (3) feet 
(9 15 mm) in length as close as possible to the 
trap. Closet flanges shall be securely fastened 
with corrosive resistant fasteners to the floor 
with top surface one-quarter ('14) inch (6.4

ings shall be readily visible for inspection. 
[UPC 309.0] 

Protection of Piping. 
Storage. Pipe and fittings should not be 
stored for long periods in direct sunlight. 
However, exposure to direct sunlight during 
normal construction periods is not harmful. 
Pipe shall be stored in such a manner as to 
prevent sagging or bending. 

Trenching, Excavation, and Backfill. 
Trenching. The width of the trench at any 
point below the top of the pipe should not be 
greater than necessary to provide adequate 

room for joining the pipe and compacting the 
side fills. [UPC 314.0] 
Alignment and Grade. The pipe should be 

bedded true to line and grade, uniformly and 
continuously supported on firm, stable mate­
rial. Blocking shall not be used to bring the 
pipe to grade. The bedding shall conform to 
Section 718.0 of the Uniform Plumbing Code. 

Backfill. The backfill shall conform to 
Section 314.4 of the Uniform Plumbing Code. 













2.7 	Joints. 2.7.3.4

3. 	Slide the gasket on the spigot and against 
the backup ring and snap it to remove any 
2.7.4.6 
twist. 
4. 	Force the spigot into the socket. Check that the joint is properly connected by using any thin feeler gauge that the gasket is not looped back over the backup 
ring. 


2.7.3 	Solvent Cement Joints. 
2.7.3.1 	Selection. Solvent cement shall be recom­mended for ABS by the manufacturer. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for types of 2.7.4.7 solvent cement for such conditions as temper­ature over 100°F (38°C), or humidity over 60%. 
2.7.3.2 	Handling (to maintain effectiveness). 
Solvent cement containers no larger than 1 quart (1 liter) should be used in the field (to avoid thickening due to evaporation). Keep container closed and in the shade when not in use. Keep applicator submerged in solvent cement between applications. When solvent cement becomes thicker, THROW IT A WAY. Solvent cement shall NOT be 
thinned. 


2.7.3.3 	Size of Applicator. 
Applicator should be about one half the pipe diameter. Do not use small applicator on large pipes. Ordinary pure bristle paint brush or applicators furnished with product are satisfactory. 









Application. Solvent cement shall be applied deliberately, but without delay (two men may be needed to make large joints). Use special care when temperature is over 100°F (38°C) or humidity is over 60%. 
Safety Requirements and Precautions. General. Solvents contained in ABS plastic pipe cements are classified as airborne con­taminants and flammable and combustible liquids. Precautions listed in this appendix 


should be followed to avoid injury to person­nel and the hazard of fire. Safety Precautions. Prolonged breathing of 
solvent vapors should be avoided. When pipe 

0 and fittings are being joined in partially enclosed areas, a ventilating device should be used in such a manner to minimize the entry of vapors into the breathing areas. 
Solvent cements should be kept away from all sources of ignition, heat, sparks, and open flame. 
Containers for solvent cements should be kept tightly closed except when the cement is being used. 

All rags and other materials used for mopping up spills should be kept in a safety waste receptacle which should be emptied daily. 
Most of the solvents used in ABS pipe cements can be considered eye irritants and contact with the eye should be avoided for it may cause eye injury. Proper eye protection and the use of chemical goggles or face shields is advisable where the possibility of splashing exists in handling solvent cements. In case of eye contact, flush with plenty of water for 15 minutes and call a physician immediately. 

Repeated contact with the skin should be avoided. Proper gloves impervious to and unaffected by the solvents should be worn when frequent contact with the skin is likely.

Application of the solvents or solvent cements with rags and bare hand is not recommended. Brushes and other suitable applicators. can be used effectively for applying the solvent cement, thus avoiding skin contact. In the event of excessive contact, remove contami­nated clothing and wash skin with soap and water. 

Step 1 	Cut pipe square with hand saw and miter box, mechanical cut­off saw, or tube cutter designed for plastic. 
Step 2 	Ream inside and chamfer 
outside of pipe (to eliminate all 
burrs).

Step 6 


Step 7 0 Step 8 

Step 9 Check dry fit of pipe in fitting. Pipe should enter fitting socket from l!J to  depth of socket. 








Apply a light coat of ABS solvent cement to inside of socket using straight outward strokes (to keep excess solvent out of socket). This is also to prevent solvent cement damage to pipe. For loose fits, apply a second coat of solvent cement. Time is important at this stage. See Section 2.7.3.4. 
While both the inside socket surface and the outside surface of the pipe are SOFT and WET with solvent cement, forcefully bottom the pipe in the socket, giving the pipe a one-quarter turn, if possible. The pipe must go to the bottom of the socket. 
Hold the joint together until tight 
(partial set). Wipe excess cement from the pipe. A properly made joint will normally show a bead around its entire perimeter. Any gaps may indicate insufficient cement or the use of light bodied cement on iarger diameters where heavy bodied cement should have been used. 
The system shall not be tested until the joints have cured (set) at least as long as recommended by the manufacturer. 







2.7.5 	Special Joints. 
2.7.5.1 	Connection to Non-Plastic Pipe. When con­necting plastic pipe to other types piping, use only approved types of fittings and adapters, designed for the specific transition intended.

Safety Requirements and Precautions1• 

(a) 	
General. Solvents contained in CPVC plastic pipe cements are classified as airborne contaminants and flammable and combustible liquids. Precautions listed in this appendix should be followed to avoid injury to personnel and the hazard of fire. 

(b) 
Prolonged breathing of solvent vapors should be avoided. When pipe and fittings are being joined in partially enclosed areas, a ventilating device should be used in such a manner to minimize the entry of vapors into the breathing areas. 

(c) 	
Solvent cements should be kept away from all sources of ignition, heat, sparks and open flame. 

(d) 	
Containers for solvent cements should be kept tightly closed except when the cement is being used. 

(e) 	
All rags and other materials used for mopping up spills should be kept in a safety waste receptacle which should be emptied daily. 

(f) 	
Most of the solvents used in CPVC pipe cements can be considered eye irritants

In case of eye contact, flush with plenty of water for 15 minutes and call a physician immediately. (g) Repeated contact with the skin should be avoided. Proper gloves impervious to and unaffected by the solvents should be worn when frequent contact with the skin is likely. Application of the solvents or solvent cements with rags and bare hands is not recommended. Brushes and other suitable applicators can be used effec­tively for applying the solvent cement, thus avoiding skin contact. In the event of excessive contact, remove contaminated clothing and wash skin with soap and water.  Step 5 Step 6 Step 7 Step 8 Pipe should enter fitting socket 114 to % of socket depth. On larger sizes of Sch. 80 fittings, a looser fit may be expected. This is a normal condition, and requires care to apply an adequate amount of cement. Apply CPVC primer, if required (see Section 2.7.4) to inside of fitting socket. Take care to avoid puddling. Apply CPVC primer, if required to outside surface of pipe to depth of fitting socket.

2.3 	Joints. 
2.3.1 	General Information. Copper tube and fit­tings maybe joined in a number of ways, depending on the purpose of the system. Soldering and brazing with capillary fittings are the methods used most. 
The American Welding Society defines sol­dering as a joining process which takes place below 840°F ( 449°C) and brazing as a similar process which occurs above 840°F ( 449°C) but below the melting point of the base metals. In actual practice for copper systems, most soldering is done at temperatures ranging from about 350°F to 550°F (177° to 288°C), while most brazing is done at temper­atures ranging from 1100° F to 1500°F (593°C to 816°C). The choice between solder­ing or brazing will generally depend on oper­ating conditions. Solder joints are generally used where the service temperature does not exceed 205°F (96°C), while brazed joints can be used where greater strength is required, or where system temperatures are as high as Consideration should also be given to the stresses on the joint caused by thermal expan-
CJ 
sion and contraction. However, stresses due to temperature changes should not be significant in two commonly encountered cases: when tube lengths are short, or when expansion loops are used in long tube runs. 
Solder is generally used in wire form, but paste-type solders are also available. These are finely granulated solders in suspension in a paste flux. When using paste-type solders, observe these four rules: 

1. 	Wire solder must be applied in addition to the paste to fill the voids and assist in

displacing the flux, otherwise the sur­faces may be well "tinned" and yet there 
may not be a good joint with a continu­ous bond. 

2. 	The paste mixture must be thoroughly stirred if it has been standing in the can for more than a very short time, as the solder has a tendency to settle rapidly to the bottom.

state and municipal regulations by reference 
after it has been cleaned. Therefore, the flux should be applied as soon as possible after cleaning. 
CAUTION 
Careless workmanship, especially during flux applications, can result in corrosion of the tube long after the system has been installed. If excessive flux is used, the residue inside the tube can cause corrosion. In an extreme case, s:uch residual flux can actually lead to perfora­bon through the tube wall causing leakage. To 
guard against this danger, it is important (1) to

choose a flux that is not too corrosive, and (2) to use only the minimum amount actually needed to make the joint.

The flame should now be moved sive pads, or a properly sized fitting brush. onto the fitting. Then move the flame from the 


fitting socket back onto the tube a distance equal to the depth of the fitting socket. Touch the solder to the joint. If the solder does not melt, remove it and continue the heating process. Be careful not to overheat or to direct the flame into the fitting cup. This could cause the flux to bum and destroy its effectiveness. When the melting temperature of the solder has been reached, heat may be applied to the 2.3.6.2 base of the cup to aid capillary action in drawing the solder into the cup. 

2.3.5.8 	Applying the Filler Metal. For tube in a hor­izontal position, start applying the solder slightly off-center at the bottom of the joint. Proceed across the bottom of the fitting and up to the top center position. Return to the point of beginning, overlap the starting point, and then proceed up the incompleted side to the top, again, overlapping the solder. 
For joints in the vertical position, a similar sequence of overlapping passes should be made, starting wherever is convenient. Molten 2.3.6.3 solder will be drawn into the joint by capillary action regardless of whether the solder is being fed upward, downward, or horizontally. 

2.3.5.9 	Cooling and Cleaning. After the joint has been completed, natural cooling is best. Shock cooling with water may cause unnecessary stress on the joint and result in eventual failure. When cool, clean off any remaining flux with a wet rag. 
2.3.6 	Brazed Joints. Brazing is the second most commonly used method for joining copper tube. Making brazed joints is similar to making soldered joints with respect to mea­suring, cutting, reaming, cleaning, assembly and support. And as in soldering, the brazing filler metal is melted by the heat of the tube 
2.3.6.4 
and fitting and drawn into the joint by capil­
lary action. [UPC 605.3.1] 
The major differences between soldering and 
brazing are the: 
o 
Type of flux used, 
o 
Composition of filler metal, and 
o 
Amount of heat required to melt the filler metal. 

2.3.6.1 	Brazing Flux. The fluxes used for brazing copper joints are different in composition from soldering fluxes. The two types cannot be used interchangeably. Brazing fluxes are water based, whereas most soldering fluxes are petroleum based. Similar to soldering fluxes, brazing fluxes dissolve and remove residual oxide from the metal surface, protect the metal from reoxidation during heating and promote wetting of the surfaces to be joined by the brazing filler metal. 

Fluxes also provide the draftsman with an indication of temperature. Application of the flux is the same as when soldering. If the outside of the fitting and the heat-affected area of the tube are covered with flux (in addition to the end of the tube and the cup), oxidation will be prevented and the appear­ance of the joint will be greatly improved. 


Brazing Filler Metals. There are two general types of brazing filler metal used for joining copper tube. Classified according to their com­ponents, they are: BCuP (Brazing-Copper-Phosphorous) and BAg (Brazing-Silver). 
BCuP filler metals are preferred for joining 

C)copper tube and fittings. The phosphorous in them acts as a fluxing agent and the lower percentage of silver makes them relatively low cost. When using copper tube, wrought copper fittings, and BCuP brazing filler metal, fluxing is optional. However, when cast fit­tings are brazed, flux must be used. Heating. Oxy/fuel torches are generally used for brazing because of the higher temperatures required. Recent innovations in tip design make air/fuel torches useful on a wider range of sizes for brazing. When working at brazing temperatures, safety precautions must be followed and care taken to protect both the operator and the materials being used. The heating operation is the same as for sol­dering. First preheat the tube and then the tube and fitting. When the filler metal starts to melt, apply heat at the base of the fitting socket to help draw the brazing filler metal in by capillary action. Applying Brazing Filler Metal. Remember to allow the heat of the joint, not the flame, to melt the filler metal. The melted filler metal will be drawn into the joint by capillary action. It is very important that the flame be in continuous motion. It must not be allowed to remain on any one point long enough to bum through the tube or fitting. If the filler metal fails to flow, or has the ten­dency to ball-up, it indicates either that there is oxide on the surfaces being joined or that the parts to be joined are not hot enough. If the filler metal refuses to enter the joint, the fitting cup is not hot enough. If it tends to flow over the outside of either part of the joint it indicates that part is overheated. When the joint is com­pleted, a continuous fillet should be visible completely around the joint. Large diameter tube is more difficult to heat to the desired temperature.

-
Table 31 3.1 of the Uniform Plumbing Code. 

3.4 	Bending Copper tube, properly bent, will 
-
not collapse on the outside of the bend and will not buckle on the inside of the bend. Tests demonstrate that the bursting strength of a bent copper tube can be greater than it was before bending. Because copper is readily formed, expansion loops and other bends nec­essary in an assembly are quickly and simply made if the proper method and equipment are used. Simple hand tools employing mandrels, dies, forms, and fillers, or power-operated bending machines, are used. 

3.4.1 	Both annealed tube and bending-temper tube can be bent with hand benders. The proper size bender for each size tube must be used. Usually the size of the tool corresponds to the nominal outside diameter of the tube, not the standard tube size. For a guide to the typical bend radii, see the following bending guide for copper tube.

Protection of Hoses. 

Storage. Unprotected hose shall not be stored in direct sunlight. The hose shall be stored in a way to protect it from mechanical damage (slitting, puncturing, etc.). Exposure to sunlight during normal construction periods is not harmful. PVC solvent cement shall be stored in a cool place, except when actually in use at the job site. The solvent cement manu­facturer's specific storage recommendations shall be followed. 
Thermal Expansion. Hose shall be "snaked" in the trench bottom with enough slack, at least 6 in. (152.4 mm) per 100 ft. (30.5 m), to compensate for thermal expansion and contraction before stabilizing hose. Stabilize hose by bringing it approximately to operating temperature before testing and backfilling by one of the following methods: 
(a) 
Backfill with a layer of soil for shading. 

(b) 
Fill with water at operating temperature. 


(c) 
Allow to stand overnight. Exposed Hose. Hose above grade when located on the exterior of the building or structure shall be protected from mechanical damage to the satisfaction of the Administra­


tive Authority. Where exposed to sunlight, the hose shall be wrapped with at least 0.040 in. 
(1.0 mm) of tape or other approved method acceptable to the Administrative Authority. 
Trenching, Cover, and Backfill. 

Trenching and Cover. Trench bottoms shall be uniformly graded and shall be of either undisturbed soil or shall consist of a layer or layers of compacted backfill so that minimum settlement will take place. 
Backfill. Selected backfill shall be used to provide firm continuous support and proper compaction. Backfill over hose, except that joints shall be left exposed. After inspection and pressure test, complete backfill to a minimum of 12 in. (0.3 m) cover.

5.1.5.5 	As the solvent dissipates, the cement layer and the dissolved surfaces will harden with a corresponding increase in joint strength. A good joint will take the required working pressure long before the joint is fully dry and final strength is obtained. In the tight (fused) part of the joint, strength will develop more quickly than in the looser (bonded) part of the joint. Completed joints should not be disturbed until they have cured sufficiently to withstand handling. Joint strength develops as

A 	It is important to note that at temperatures colder than 20°F (-6.7°C) on size that exceed 3 in. (76.2 mm), test results indicate that many variables exist in the actual cure rate of the joint. The data expressed in these categories represent only estimated averages. In some cases, cure will be achieved in less 
u 

time, but isolated test results indicate that even longer periods of cure may be required. B These cure schedules are based on laboratory test data obtained on Net Fit Joints (NET FIT = in a dry fit the pipe bottoms snugly in the fitting socket without meeting interference). The relative humidity in these test was 50% or less. Higher relative humidity may require longer cure periods.

COMBINATION OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR COMBUSTION AND VENTILATION 
OPENING DESIGN 

(The content of this Appendix is based on Annex J of NFPA 54) 
0 	J 1.0 General. 
0 
J 1.1 Example of Combination Indoor and Outdoor Combustion Air Opening. Determine the -required combination of indoor and outdoor combustion air opening sizes for the following appliance installation example. 
Example Installation: A fan-assisted furnace and a draft hood-equipped water heater with the following inputs are located in a 15 foot (4572 mm) by 30 foot (9144 mm) basement with an 8 foot (2438 mm) ceiling. No additional indoor spaces shall be used to help meet the appliance combustion air needs. 
Fan-Assisted Furnace Input: 100 000 British thermal units per hour (Btu/h) (29 kW) 
Draft Hood-Equipped Water Heater Input: 40 000 Btu/h 
(11.7 kW) 



Solution: (1) Determine the total available room volume. 
Equipment room volume: 
15 feet (4572 mm) by 30 feet (9144 mm) with an 8 foot (2438 mm) ceiling= 3600 cubic feet (101.94 m3) 
(2) Determine the total required volume. 
. The standard method to determine combustion air shall be used to calculate the required volume. 
The combined input for the appliances located in the basement is calculated as follows: 

0 
100 000 Btu/h (29 kW) + 40 000 Btu/h (11.7 kW) = 
140 000 Btu/h (4 1 kW) 

The standard method requires that the required volume be determined based on 50 cubic feet per 1000 Btu/h 
(4.83 m3/kW). 

0 
Using Table J 1.1, the required volume for a 140 000 Btulh ( 41 kW) water heater is 7000 cubic feet (198.22 
m3). 
Conclusion: 
Indoor volume is insufficient to supply combustion air since the total of3600 cubic feet (101.94 m3) does not meet 


( \
\___) 	the required volume of 7000 cubic feet (198.22 m3). Therefore, additional combustion air shall be provided from the outdoors. 
(3) 	Determine ratio of the available volume to the required volume. 
3600 cubic feet = 0·51 7000 cubic feet 

(4) 	Determine the reduction factor to be used to reduce the full outdoor air opening size to the minimum required based on ratio of indoor spaces. 
1.00 -0.51 (from Step 3) = 0.49 

(5) 	Determine the single outdoor combustion air opening size as where combustion air is to come from outdoors. In this example, the combustion air opening directly communicates with the outdoors. 
140 000 Btu/h 

4 7 square inches 3000 British thermal units (0.03 m2)per square inch (Btu/in2) 

(6) Determine the minimum outdoor combustion air 
opening area. 
Outdoor opening area = 0.49 (from Step 4) x 47 square 
inches (0.03 m2) = 23 square inches (0.01 m2) 

Section 506.5.3(3) requires the minimum dimension of the air opening shall be not less than 3 inches (76 mm).

METRIC SYSTEM 


(INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS -Sl} 
For the users of this code, we are including a short explanation and some conversion tables to aid in the conversion of our familiar English units to the forthcoming SI units. This is written with the code users in mind, and will detail only those measurements used in everyday work and calcula­tions. For the scientific units, we recommend the use of ANSI Z210.1, "Metric Practice Guide." 


GENERAL COMMENTS 
Our present system of measuring involves the three dimensions of force, length and time. The SI units involve mass, length, and time. The change of force to mass has meaning in scientific and engineering work, but for practical use in ordinary con­struction, we will show kilogram to pounds conversion values, although an exact conversion would be pounds force divided by 
0 

the acceleration due to gravity to mass units. In the same manner, the SI units for temperature expressed in Kelvins and based on absolute zero will be given as degrees Celsius, which is the more familiar and practical Centigrade degrees. The SI system measures angles in radians where there are 2 pi radians in a circle, but using a 1.5708 bend to change from a vertical stack to a horizontal house drain is not as easy as calling out a Y4 bend or an ell for water piping. The foregoing notes are intended to show that in making conversions from one unit system to another, a little common sense must be used and the degree of accuracy needed to do the job at hand. The following tables are set up using this approach and using the preferred SI units.

When the plumbing industry, including plumbers, suppliers, and manufacturers, actually begins the metric conversion pro­gram, it will undoubtedly follow the guidelines of committees selected from all phases of the construction industry as set up under 
the American National Metric Council. 
The final preferred units used will be those that apply to our industry and will be of the magnitude to simplify and ease job calculations and avoid confusion and ambiguity. 
The conversion looks complex and confusing, but when the metric system was first proposed in France, an attempt was made to include a ten-hour day, a ten-day week, and ten months to the year, but cooler heads prevailed and our time still follows the sun and seasons. Likewise, assigning new units or numbers to the quantities we must work with cannot change the basic hydraulic principles that plumbers have worked with throughout history. 
Information on conversion factors is.provided by ANSI, the American National Metric Council, and the Division of Des­ignatronics, Inc.
