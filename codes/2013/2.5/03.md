R301.1.1.1 Alternative provisions for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings. The purpose of this sub≠section is to permit alternatives that provide minimum protection of life, limb, health, property, safety and
.. welfare of the general public and the owners and occu≠pants of limited-density owner-built rural dwellings as defined in Chapter 2 of this code. For additional infor≠mation see Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Article 8, of Title 25, California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 74.
To meet compliance with the requirements of this code, provisions ofSection R301.1.1.1, Items 1 though 5
may be ∑utilized for limited-density owner-built rural dwellings when the materials, methods of construction, or appliances are determined appropriate or suitable for their intended purpose by the local enforcing agency.
1. 	
A limited-density owner-built rural dwelling may be of any type of construction which will provide for a sound structural condition. Structural haz≠ards which result in an unsound condition and which may constitute a substandard building are delineated in Section 17920.3 of the Health and
Safety Code.


2.
There shall be no requirements for room dimen≠sions as required in Chapter 3, provided there is adequate light and ventilation and means of egress.

3. 	
There shall be no specified requirement for heat≠ing capacity or for temperature maintenance. The use of solid-fuel or solar heating devices shall be deemed as complying with the require≠
ments of Chapter 3. If nonrenewable fuel is used in these dwellings, rooms so heated shall meet





∑
current installation standards.

4.
Pier foundations, 	stone masonry footings and foundations, pressure-treated lumber, poles or equivalent foundation materials or designs may be used provided that bearing is sufficient.

5.
Owner-produced or 	used materials and appli≠ances may be utilized unless found not to be of sufficient strength or durability to perform the intended function. Owner-produced or used lum≠ber, or shakes and shingles may be utilized unless found to contain dry rot, excessive splitting or other defects obviously rendering the material unfit in strength or durability for the intended purpose.







all loads,


requirements in Section R301 .1 the following standards are permitted subject to the limitations of this code and the limitations therein. Where engineered design is used in conjunction with these standards, the design . shall comply with the California Building Code.
1.
AF&PA 	Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM).

2. 	
AISI Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing≠Prescriptive Method for One-and Two.:.Family Dwellings (AlSI S230).

3.
ICC 	Standard on the Design and Construction of Log Structures (ICC 400).

R301.1.2 Construction systems. The requirements of this code are based on platform and balloon-frame construc≠
tion for light-frame buildings. The requirements for con≠crete and masonry buildings are based on a balloon framing system. Other framing systems must have equiva≠lent detailing to ensure force transfer, continuity and com patible deformations.
R301.1.3 Engineered design. When a building of other≠wise conventional construction contains structural ele≠ments exceeding the limits of Section R301 or otherwise
not conforming to this code, these elements ∑ shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering prac≠

tice. The extent of such design need only demonstrate compliance of nonconventional elements with other appli≠cable provisions and shall be compatible with the perfor≠
mance of the conventional framed system. Engineered design in accordance with the California Building Code is permitted for all buildings and structures, and parts thereof, included in the scope of this code.



R301.1.3.1 California licensed architect or engineer.
When any portion of any structure deviates from sub≠
stantial compliance with conventional framing require≠ments for woodframe construction found in this code, the building official shall require the construction doc≠uments to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for that irregular or non≠sections of law, the law establishing these provisions is found in Business and Professions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1.

R301.1.3.2 Woodframe structures greater than two≠stories. The building official shall require construction documents to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer for all dwellings of woodframe construction more than two stories and basement in height. Notwithstanding other sections of
law, the law establishing these provisions is found in


panels prescribed by this code to be approved and stamped by a California licensed architect or engineer. Notwithstanding other sections of law, the law estab≠


lishing these provisions is found in Business and Pro≠fessions Code Sections 5537 and 6737.1.
R301.2 Climatic and geographic design criteria. Buildings shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of this code as limited by the provisions of this section. Additional criteria shall be established by the local jurisdiction and set forth in Table R301.2 (1).

R301.2.1 Wind design criteria. Buildings and portions thereof shall be constructed in accordance with the wind provisions of this code using the basic wind speed in Table R301.2(1) as determined from Figure R301.2(4)A. The structural provisions of this code for wind loads are not
permitted where wind design is required as specified in Section R301.2.1.1. Where different construction meth≠ods and structural materials are used for various portions of a building, the applicable requirements of this section for each portion shall apply. Where not otherwise speci≠fied, the wind loads listed in Table R301.2(2) adjusted for height and exposure using Table R301 .2(3) shall be used to determine design load performance requirements for wall coverings, curtain walls, roof coverings, exterior win≠dows, skylights, garage doors and exterior doors. Asphalt shingles shall be designed for wind speeds in accordance with Section R905.2.4. A continuous load path shall be provided to transmit the applicable uplift forces in Section R802. 11.1 from the roof assembly to the foundation.
R301.2.1.1 Wind limitations and wind design required. The wind provisions of this code shall not apply to the design of buildings where wind design is required in accordance with Figure R301 .2(4)B or where the basic wind speed from Figure R301.2(4)A equals or exceeds 110 miles per hour (49 m/s).
Exceptions:
1.
For concrete construction, the wind provisions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Sections R404 and R611.

2.
For structural insulated panels, the wind provi≠sions of this code shall apply in accordance with the limitations of Section R6 13.








In regions where wind design is required in accor≠dance with Figure R301.2(4)B or where the basic wind speed shown on Figure R301.2(4)A equals or exceeds 110 miles per hour (49 m/s), the design of buildings for wind loads shall be in accordance with one or more of the following methods:
1.
AF&PA 	Wood Frame Construction Manual (WFCM);or

2.
ICC 	Standard for Residential Construction in High-Wind Regions (ICC 600); or

3.

R301.2.1.3 Wind speed conversion. When referenced documents are based on fastest mile wind speeds, the three-second gust basic wind speeds, V3,, of Figure R301.2( 4) shall be converted to fastest mile wind speeds, Vftn, using Table R301.2.1.3.

R301.2.1.4 Exposure category. For each wind direc≠tion considered, an exposure category that adequately reflects the characteristics of ground surface irregulari≠ties shall be determined for the site at which the build≠ing or structure is to be constructed. For a site located in the transition zone between categories, the category resulting in the largest wind forces shall apply. Account shall be taken of variations in ground surface roughness that arise from natural topography and vege≠tation as well as from constructed features. For a site where multiple detached one-and two-family dwell≠ings, townhouses or other structures are to be con≠structed as part of a subdivision, master-planned community, or otherwise designated as a developed area by the authority having jurisdiction, the exposure category for an individual structure shall be based upon the site conditions that will exist at the time when all adjacent structures on the site have been con≠structed, provided their construction is expected to begin within one year of the start of construction for the structure for which the exposure category is deter≠mined. For any given wind direction, the . exposure in which a specific building or other structure is sited shall be assessed as being one of the following catego≠ries:


∑

1. Exposure A. Large city centers with at least 50

percent of the buildings having a height in excess
of70 feet (21 336 mm). Use of this exposure cat≠
egory shall be limited to those areas for
. which
terrain representative of Exposure A prevails in
the upwind direction for a distance of at least 0.5
mile (0.8 km) or 10 times the height of the build≠
ing or other structure, whichever is greater. Possi≠
ble channeling effects or increased velocity
pressures due to the building or structure being
located in the wake of adjacent buildings shall be
taken into account.


2.
Exposure B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded
areas, or other terrain with numerous closely
spaced obstructions having the size of single≠
family dwellings or larger. Exposure B shall be
assumed unless the site meets the definition of











C)
another type exposure.
3, Exposure C. Open terrain with scattered obstruc≠
tions, including surface undulations or other
irregularities, having heights generally less than
30 feet (9144 mm) extending more than 1,500

4. 	Exposure D. Flat, unobstructed areas exposed to wind flowing over open water for a distance of at least 1 mile (1.61 km). Shorelines in Exposure D include inland waterways, the Great Lakes, and coastal areas of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. This exposure shall apply only to those buildings and other structures exposed to the wind coming from over the water. Exposure D extends inland from the shoreline a distance of 1500 feet (457 m) or 10 times the height of the building or structure, whichever is greater.
R301.2.1.5 Topographic wind effects. In areas desig≠nated in Table R301.2(1) as having local historical data documenting structural damage to buildings caused by wind speed-up at isolated hills, ridges and escarpments that are abrupt changes from the general topography of the area, topographic wind effects shall be considered in.the design of the building in accordance with Section R301.2.1.5;1 or in accordance with the provisions of ASCE 7. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(1) for topographic features for wind speed-up effect.
In these designated areas, topographic wind effects
shall apply only to buildings sited on the top half of an isolated hill, ridge or escarpment where all of the fol≠lowing conditions exist:
1. 	
The average slope of the top half of the hill, ridge or escarpment is 10 percent or greater.

2. 	
The hill, ridge or escarpment is 60 feet (18 288 mm) or greater in height for Exposure B, 30 feet (9144 mm) or greater in height for Exposure C, and 15 feet (4572 mm) or greater in height for Exposure D.

3. 	
The hill, ridge or escarpment is isolated or unob≠structed by other topographic features of similar height in the upwind direction for a distance mea≠sured from its high point of 100 times its height or 2 miles, whichever is less. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(3) for upwind obstruction.

4. 	
The hill, ridge or escarpment protrudes by a factor of two or more above the height of other upwind topographic features located in any quadrant within a radius of 2 miles measured from its high point.


R301.2.1.5.1 Simplified topographic wind speed≠up method. As an alternative to the ASCE 7 topo≠graphic wind provisions, the provisions of Section



2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE BUILDING PLANNING



R301.2.1.5.1 shall be permitted to be used to design
for wind speed-up effects, where required by Section
R301.2.1.5.

Structures located on the top half of isolated hills, ridges or escarpments meeting the conditions of Section R301.2.1.5 shall be designed for an increased basic wind speed as determined by Table R301.2.1.5.1. On the high side of an escarpment, the increased basic wind speed shall extend horizontally downwind from the edge of the escarpment 1.5 times the horizontal length of the upwind slope (1.5L) or 6 times the height of the escarpment (6H), whichever is greater. See Figure R301.2.1.5.1(2) for where wind speed increase is applied.
R301.2.2 Seismic provisions. The seismic provisions of this code shall apply as follows:
1. 	
Townhouses in Seismic Design Categories C, D0, D1 and D2ï

2. 	
Detached one-and two-family dwellings in Seismic Design Categories, D0, D1 and D2ï


R301.2.2.1 Determination of seismic design cate≠gory. Buildings shall be assigned a seismic design cate≠gory in accordance with Figure R301.2(2).
R301.2.2.1.1 Alternate determination of seismic design category. The seismic design categories and corresponding short period design spectral response accelerations, Sns shown in Figure R301.2(2) are based on soil Site Class D, as defmed in Section 1613.3.2 of the California Building Code. If soil conditions are other than Site Class D, the short period design spectral response accelerations, Svsï for a site can be determined according to Section 1613.3 of the California Building Code. The value of Svs determined according to Section 1613.3 of the California Building Code is permitted to be used to set the seismic design category according to Table R301.2.2.1.1, and to interpolate between values in Tables R602.10.1.3(3), R603.9.2(1) and other seis≠mic design requirements of this code.

R313.3.6.2.2 Calculation procedure. Determina≠tion of the required size for water distribution piping shall be in accordance with the following procedure:
Step 1 -Determine P,
up
Obtain the static supply pressure that will be avail≠able from the water main from the water purveyor, or for an individual source, the available supply pressure shall be in accordance with Section
R313.3.5.1.
Step 2-Determine PL,.c
Use Table R313.3.6.2(1) to determine the pressure loss in the water service pipe based on the selected size of the water service.
Step 3 -Determine PLm
Use Table R313.3.6.2(2) to determine the pressure loss from the water meter, based on the selected water meter size.
Step 4 -Determine PL4
Determine the pressure loss from devices other than the water meter installed in the piping system sup≠plying sprinklers, such as pressure-reducing valves, backflow preventers, water softeners or water filters. Device pressure losses shall be based on the device manufacturer's specifications. The flow rate used to determine pressure loss shall be the rate from Sec≠tion R313.3.4.2, except that 5 gpm (0.3 LIS) shall be added where the device is installed in a water-ser≠vice pipe that supplies more than one dwelling. As alternative to deducting pressure loss for a device, an automatic bypass valve shall be installed to divert flow around the device when a sprinkler activates.
Step 5 -Determine PL,
Use Table R313.3.6.2(3) to determine the pressure loss associated with changes in elevation. The eleva≠tion used in applying the table shall be the difference between the elevation where the water source pres≠sure was measured and the elevation of the highest sprinkler.

Step 6 -Determine P,P
Determine the maximum pressure required by any individual sprinkler based on the flow rate from Sec≠tion R313.3.4.1. The required pressure is provided in the sprinkler manufacturer's published data for the specific sprinkler model based on the selected flow rate.
Step 7 -Calculate P1
Using Equation 29-1, calculate the pressure avail≠able to offset friction loss in water-distribution pip≠ing between the service valve and the sprinklers.
Step 8 -Determine the maximum allowable pipe length
Use Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) to select a material and size for water distribution pip≠ing. The piping material and size shall be acceptable if the developed length of pipe between the service valve and the most remote sprinkler does not exceed the maximum allowable length specified by the applicable table. Interpolation of Pt between the tab≠ular values shall be permitted.
The maximum allowable length of piping in Tables R313.3.6.2(4) through R313.3.6.2(9) incor≠porates an adjustment for pipe fittings, and no addi≠tional consideration of friction losses associated with pipe fittings shall be required.

R313.3. 7 Instructions and signs. An owner' s manual for the fire sprinkler system shall be provided to the owner. A sign or valve tag shall be installed at the main shutoff valve to the water distribution system stating the follow≠ing: "Warning, the water system for this home supplies fire sprinklers that require certain flows and pressures to fight a fire. Devices that restrict the flow or decrease the pressure or automatically shut off the water to the fire sprinkler system, such as water softeners, filtration sys≠tems and automatic shutoff valves, shall not be added to this system without a review of the fire sprinkler system by a fire protection specialist. Do not remove this sign."
R313.3.8 Inspections. The water distribution system shall be inspected in accordance with Sections R313.3.8.1 and R313.3.8.2.
R313.3.8.1 Preconcealment inspection. The following items shall be verified prior to the concealment of any sprinkler system piping:
