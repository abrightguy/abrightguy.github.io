APPENDIX J
EXISTING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES



(The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.)




SECTION AJ1 01
PURPOSE AND INTENT

AJlOl.l General. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage the continued use or reuse of legally existing buildings and structures. These provisions are intended to permit work in existing buildings that is consistent with the purpose of this code. Compliance with these provisions shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this code.
AJ101.2 Classification of work. For purposes of this appen�dix, all work in existing buildings shall be classified into the categories of repair, renovation, alteration and reconstruction. Specific requirements are established for each category of work in these provisions.
AJ101.3 Multiple categories of work. Work of more than one category may be part of a single work project. All related work permitted within a 12-month period shall be considered � a single work project. Where a project includes one category of work in one building area and another category of work in a separate and unrelated area of the building, each project area shall comply with the requirements of the respective cat�egory of work. Where a project with more than one category of work is performed in the same area or in related areas of the building, the project shall comply with the requirements of the more stringent category of work.
SECTION AJ1 02
COMPLIANCE

AJ102.1 General. Regardless of the category of work being performed, the work shall not cause the structure to become unsafe or adversely affect the performance of the building;

2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE
shall not cause an existing mechanical or plumbing system to become unsafe, hazardous, insanitary or overloaded; and unless expressly permitted by these provisions, shall not make the building any less compliant with this code or to any previously approved alternative arrangements than it was before the work was undertaken. AJ102.2 Requirements by category of work. Repairs shall conform to the requirements of Section AJ301. Renovations shall conform to the requirements of Section AJ401. Altera�tions shall conform to the requirements of Section AJ501 and the requirements for renovations. Reconstructions shall con�form to the requirements of Section AJ601 and the require�ments for alterations and renovations.


AJ102.3 Smoke detectors. Regardless of the category of work, smoke detectors shall be provided where required by Section R314.3.1.
AJ102.4 Replacement windows. Regardless of the category of work, when an existing window, including the sash and glazed portion, is replaced, the replacement window shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 11.
AJ102.5 Flood hazard areas. Work performed in existing buildings located in a flood hazard area as established by Table R301.2(1) shall be subject to the provisions of Section R105.3.1.1.
AJ102.6 Equivalent alternatives. These provisions are not intended to prevent the use of any alternative material, alter�native design or alternative method of construction not spe�cifically prescribed herein, provided any alternative has been deemed to be equivalent and its use authorized by the build�ing official.
61 1 APPENDIX J


AJ102.7 Other alternatives. Where compliance with these provisions or with this code as required by these provisions is technically infeasible or would impose disproportionate costs because of structural, construction or dimensional difficul�ties, other alternatives may be accepted by the building offi�cial. These alternatives may include materials, design features and{or operational features.
AJ102.8 More restrictive requirements. Buildings or sys�tems in compliance with the requirements of this code for new construction shall not be required to comply with any more restrictive requirement of these provisions.
AJ102.9 Features exceeding code requirements. Elements, components and systems of existing buildings with features that exceed the requirements of this code for new construc�tion, and are not otherwise required as part of approved alter�native arrangements or deemed by the building official to be required to balance other building elements not complying with this code for new construction, shall not be prevented by these provisions from being modified as long as they remain in compliance with the applicable requirements for new con�struction.
SECTION AJ1 03
PRELIMINARY MEETING

AJ103.1 General. If a building permit is required at the request of the prospective permit applicant, the building offi�cial or his designee shall meet with the prospective applicant to discuss plans for any proposed work under these provi�sions prior to the application for the permit. The purpose of this preliminary meeting is for the building official to gain an understanding of the prospective applicant's intentions for the proposed work, and to determine, together with the pro�spective applicant, the specific applicability of these provi�sions.
SECTION AJ104
EVALUATION OF AN EXISTING BUILDING

AJ104.1 General. The building official may require an exist�ing building to be investigated and evaluated by a registered design professional in the case of proposed reconstruction of any portion of a building. The evaluation shall determine the existence of any potential nonconformities to these provi�sions, and shall provide a basis for determining the impact of the proposed changes on the performance of the building. The evaluation shall use the following sources of information, as applicable:
1. Available documentation of the existing building.
