Piers greater than 80 inches (2032 mm) in height may be constructed in accordance with the provisions of Item 2, provided the piers shall be filled solid with grout and reinforced with four continuous No. 5 bars. One bar shall be placed in each comer cell of hollow masonry unit piers or in each comer of the grouted space of piers constructed of solid masonry units.

4.
Cast-in-place concrete piers meeting the same size and height limitations of Items 1, 2 and 3 may be substi�tuted for piers constructed of masonry units.


SECTION AE604
ANCHORAGE INSTALLATIONS

AE604.1 Ground anchors. Ground anchors shall be designed and installed to transfer the anchoring loads to the ground. The load-carrying portion of the ground anchors shall be installed to the full depth called for by the manufacturer's installation instructions and shall extend below the estab�lished frost line into undisturbed soil.
Manufactured ground anchors shall be listed and installed in accordance with the terms of their listing and the anchor manufacturer's instructions, and shall include the means of attachment of ties meeting the requirements of Section AE605. Ground anchor manufacturer's installation instruc�tions shall include the amount of preload required and load capacity in various types of soil. These instructions shall include tensioning adjustments which may be needed to pre�vent damage to the manufactured home, particularly damage that can be caused by frost heave. Each ground anchor shall be marked with the manufacturer's identification and listed model identification number which shall be visible after installation. Instructions shall accompany each listed ground anchor specifying the types of soil for which the anchor is suitable under the requirements of this section.




Each approved ground anchor, when installed, shall be capable of resisting an allowable working load at least equal to 3,150 pounds (14 kN) in the direction of the tie plus a 50�percent overload [4,725 pounds (21 kN) total] without fail�ure. Failure shall be considered to have occurred when the anchor moves more than 2 inches (51 mm) at a load of 4,725 pounds (21 kN) in the direction of the tie installation. Those ground anchors which are designed to be installed so that


C)loads on the anchor are other than direct withdrawal shall be designed and installed to resist an applied design load of 3,150 pounds (14 kN) at 40 to 50 degrees from vertical or within the angle limitations specified by the home manufac�turer without displacing the tie end of the anchor more than 4 inches (102 mm) horizontally. Anchors designed for the con�nection of multiple ties shall be capable of resisting the com�bined working load and overload consistent with the intent expressed herein.


When it is proposed to use ground anchors and the build�ing official has reason to believe that the soil characteristics at a given site are such as to render the use of ground anchors advisable, or when there is doubt regarding the ability of the ground anchors to obtain their listed capacity, the building official may require that a representative field installation be made at the site in question and tested to demonstrate ground�anchor capacity. The building official shall approve the test procedures.


AE604.2 Anchoring equipment. Anchoring equipment, when installed as a permanent installation, shall be capable of resisting all loads as specified within these provisions. When the stabilizing system is designed by an engineer or architect licensed by the state to practice as such, alternative designs may be used, providing the anchoring equipment to be used is capable of withstanding a load equal to 1.5 times the calcu�lated load. All anchoring equipment shall be listed and labeled as being capable of meeting the requirements of these provisions. Anchors as specified in this code may be attached to the main frame of the manufactured home by an approved 3/6-inch-thick (4.76 mm) slotted steel plate anchoring device.


1
Other anchoring devices or methods meeting the require�ments of these provisions may be permitted when approved by the building official.


Anchoring systems shall be so installed as to be perma�nent. Anchoring equipment shall be so designed to prevent self-disconnection with no hook ends used.


AE604.3 Resistance to weather deterioration. All anchor�ing equipment, tension devices and ties shall have a resis�tance to deterioration as required by this code.
AE604.4 Tensioning devices. Tensioning devices, such as turnbuckles or yoke-type fasteners, shall be ended with clevis or welded eyes.

APPENDIX E

SECTION AE605 TIES, MATERIALS AND INSTALLATION
0
AE605.1 General. Steel strapping, cable, chain or other approved materials shall be used for ties. All ties shall be fas�tened to ground anchors and drawn tight with turnbuckles or other adjustable tensioning devices or devices supplied with the ground anchor. Tie materials shall be capable of resisting an allowable working load of 3,150 pounds (14 kN) with no
0
more than 2 percent elongation and shall withstand a 50-per�cent overload [4,750 pounds (21 kN)] . Ties shall comply with the weathering requirements of Section AE604.3. Ties shall connect the ground anchor and the main structural frame. Ties shall not connect to steel outrigger beams which fasten to and intersect the main structural frame unless specifically stated in the manufacturer's installation instructions. Connec�tion of cable ties to main frame members shall be 5/8-inch
(15.9 mm) closed-eye bolts affixed to the frame member in an approved manner. Cable ends shall be secured with at least two U-bolt cable clamps with the "U" portion of the clamp installed on the short (dead) end of the cable to ensure strength equal to that required by this section.
Wood floor support systems shall be fixed to perimeter foundation walls in accordance with provisions of this code. The minimum number of ties required per side shall be suffi�cient to resist the wind load stated in this code. Ties shall be as evenly spaced as practicable along the length of the manu�factured home with the distance from each end of the home and the tie nearest that end not exceeding 8 feet (2438 mm). When continuous straps are provided as vertical ties, such ties shall be positioned at rafters and studs. Where a vertical tie and diagonal tie are located at the same place, both ties may be connected to a single anchor, provided the anchor used is capable of carrying both loads. Multiple-section manufac�tured homes require diagonal ties only. Diagonal ties shall be installed on the exterior main frame and slope to the exterior at an angle of 40 to 50 degrees from the vertical or within the angle limitations specified by the home manufacturer. Verti�cal ties which are not continuous over the top of the manufac�tured home shall be attached to the main frame.
