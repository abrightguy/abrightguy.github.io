R802.1 Identification. Load-bearing dimension lumber for rafters, trusses and ceiling joists shall be identified by a grade mark of a lumber grading or inspection agency that has been approved by an accreditation body that complies with DOC PS 20. In lieu of a grade mark, a certificate of inspection issued by a lumber grading or inspection agency meeting the requirements of this section shall be accepted.
Note: See Section R301.1.1.1 for limited-density owner≠built rural dwellings.

R802.1.1 Blocking. Blocking shall be a minimum of util≠ity grade lumber.
R802.1.2 End-jointed lumber. Approved end-jointed lumber identified by a grade mark conforming to Section R802. 1 may be used interchangeably with solid-sawn members of the same species and grade. End-jointed lum≠ber used in an assembly required elsewhere in this code to have a fire-resistance rating shall have the designation "Heat-Resistant Adhesive" or "HRA" included in its grade mark

R802.1.3

Fire-retardant-treated wood. Fire-retardant≠treated wood (FRTW) is any wood product which, when impregnated with chemicals by a presslire process or other means during manufacture, shall have, when tested in accordance with ASTM E 84 or UL 723, a listed flame spread index of 25 or less and shows no evidence of sig≠nificant progressive combustion when the test is continued for an additional 20-minute period. In addition, the flame front shall not progress more than .10.5 feet (3200 mm) beyond the center line of the burners at any time during the test.
R802.1.3.1 Pressure process. For wood products impregnated with chemicals by a pressure process, the process shall be performed in closed vessels under pressures not less than 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) (344.7 kPa).
R802.1.3.2 Other means during manufacture. For wood products produced by other means during manu≠facture the treatment shall be an integral part of the manufacturing process of the wood product. The treat≠ment shall provide permanent protection to all surfaces of the wood product.














R802.1.3.3 Testing. For wood products produced by other means during manufacture, other than a pressure process, all sides of the wood product shall be tested in accordance with and produce the results required in Section R802.1.3.

a. 	The tabulated rafter spans assume that ceiling joists are located at the bottom of the attic space or that some other method of resisting the outward push of the rafters on the bearing walls, such as rafter ties, is provided at that location. When ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic space, the rafter
spans shall be multiplied by the factors given below:

CEILING FINISHES

RSOS.l Ceiling installation. Ceilings shall be installed in accordance with the requirements for interior wall finishes as provided in Section R702.
SECTION R806
ROOF VENTILATION

R806.1 Ventilation required. Enclosed attics and enclosed rafter spaces formed where ceilings are applied directly to the underside of roof rafters shall have cross ventilation for each separate space by ventilating openings protected against the entrance of rain or snow. Ventilation openings shall have a least dimension of 1/6 inch (1.6 mm) minimum and 1/4 inch
1
(6.4 mm) maximum. Ventilation openings having a least dimension larger than 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) shall be provided with corrosion-resistant wire cloth screening, hardware cloth, or similar material with openings having a least dimension of 1/6inch (1.6 mm) minimum and 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) maximum.
1Openings in roof framing members shall conform to the requirements of Section R802.7. Required ventilation open≠ings shall open directly to the outside air.
Exception: Attic ventilation shall not be required when determined not necessary by the code official due to atmo≠spheric or climatic conditions.
R806.2 Minimum vent area. The minimum net free ventilat≠ing area shall be 1 I 50 of the area of the vented space.
1 Exception: The minimum net free ventilation area shall be 1/00 of the vented space provided one or more of the fol≠
3
lowing conditions are met:

1.
In Climate Zones 	14 and 16, a Class I or ll vapor retarder is installed on the warm-in-winter side of the ceiling.

2.
At least 40 percent and not more than 50 percent of the required ventilating area is provided by ventila≠tors located in the upper portion of the attic or rafter space. Upper ventilators shall be located no more









than 3 feet (914 mm) below the ridge or highest point of the space, measured vertically, with the bal≠ance of the required ventilation provided by eave or cornice vents. Where the location of wall or roof framing members conflicts with the installation of upper ventilators, installation more than 3 feet (914 mm) below the ridge or highest point of the space shall be permitted.
R806.3 Vent and insulation clearance. Where eave or cor≠nice vents are installed, insulation shall not block the free flow of air. A minimum of a l-inch (25 mm) space shall be provided between the insulation and the roof sheathing and at the location of the vent.
R806.4 Installation and weather protection. Ventilators shall be installed in accordance with manufacturer's installa≠tion instructions. Installation of ventilators in roof systems shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section R903. Instaliation of ventilators in wall systems shall be in accor≠dance with the requirements of Section R703.1.
R806.5 Unvented attic and unvented enclosed rafter assemblies. Unvented attic assemblies (spaces between the ceiling joists of the top story and the roof rafters) and unvented enclosed rafter assemblies (spaces between ceilings that are applied directly to the underside of roof framing members/rafters and the structural roof sheathing at the top of the roof framing members/rafters) shall be permitted if all the following conditions are met:

1.
The 	unvented attic space is completely contained within the building thermal envelope.

2.
No interior Class I vapor retarders are installed on the ceiling side (attic floor) of the unvented attic assembly or on the ceiling side of the unvented enclosed rafter assembly.

3.
Where wood shingles or shakes are used, a minimum 1/4≠inch (6 mm) vented air space separates the shingles or shakes and the roofmg underlayment above the struc≠tural sheathing.

4.
In California Climate Zones 14 and 16, any air-imper≠meable insulation shall be a Class II vapor retarder, or shall have a Class III vapor retarder coating or covering in direct contact with the underside of the insulation.


See Title 24, Part 6, Figure 100.1-A-California Cli≠mate Zones.
5. 	Either Items 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 shall be met, depending on the air permeability of the insulation directly under the structural roof sheathing. No insulation shall be required when roof tiles, wood shingles or wood shakes, or any other roofing system using battens and no continuous underlayment is installed. A continuous layer shall be considered to exist if sheathing, roofing paper or any continuous layer which has a perm rate of no more than one perm under the dry cup method.
5. 1. Air-impermeable 	insulation only. Insulation shall be applied in direct contact with the under≠side of the structural roof sheathing.
5.2. Air-permeable insulation only. 	In addition to the air-permeable insulation installed directly below the structural sheathing, rigid board or


sheet insulation with an R-value of R-4 shall be
installed directly above the structural roof
sheathing for condensation control.
5.3. Air-impermeable and air-permeable insulation. The air-impermeable insulation shall be applied in direct contact with the underside of the struc≠tural roof sheathing for condensation control. The air-permeable insulation shall be installed directly under the air-impermeable insulation.
5.4. Where preformed insulation board is used as the air-impermeable insulation layer, it shall be sealed at the perimeter of each individual sheet
interior surface to form a continuous layer.
SECTION R807
ATTIC ACCESS


R807.1 Attic access. Buildings with combustible ceiling or roof construction shall have an attic access opening to attic areas that exceed 30 square feet (2.8 m2) and have a vertical height of 30 inches (762 mm) or greater. The vertical height shall be measured from the top of the ceiling framing mem≠bers to the underside of the roof framing members.
The rough-framed opening shall not be less than 22 inches by 30 inches (559 mm by 762 mm) and shall be located in a hallway or other readily accessible location. When located in a wall, the opening shall be a minimum of 22 inches wide by 30 inches high (559 mm wide by 762 mm high). When the access is located in a ceiling, minimum unobstructed head≠room in the attic space shall be 30 inches (762 mm) at some point above the access measured vertically from the bottom of ceiling framing members. See the California Mechanical Code for access requirements where mechanical equipment is located in attics.
