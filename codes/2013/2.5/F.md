SECTION AF1 02 DEFINITIONS

AF102.1 General. For the purpose of these requirements, the terms used shall be defined as follows:
DRAIN TILE LOOP. A continuous length of drain tile or perforated pipe extending around all or part of the internal or external perimeter of a basement or crawl space footing.


RADON GAS. A naturally occurring, chemically inert, radioactive gas that is not detectable by human senses. As a gas, it can move readily through particles of soil and rock, and can accumulate under the slabs and foundations of homes where it can easily enter into the living space through con�struction cracks and openings.

SOIL-GAS-RETARDER. A continuous membrane of 6-mil
(0.15 mm) polyethylene or other equivalent material used to retard the flow of soil gases into a building.
SUBMEMBRANE DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM. A system designed to achieve lower submembrane air pressure
2013 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE






relative to crawl space air pressure by use of a vent drawing air from beneath the soil-gas-retarder membrane
SUBSLAB DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM (Active).
A system designed to achieve lower subslab air pressure rela�tive to indoor air pressure by use of a fan-powered vent draw�ing air from beneath the slab. SUBSLAB DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM (Passive). A system designed to achieve lower subslab air pressure rela�tive to indoor air pressure by use of a vent pipe routed through the conditioned space of a building and connecting the subslab area with outdoor air, thereby relying on the con�vective flow of air upward in the vent to draw air from beneath the slab.

SECTION AF1 03
REQUIREMENTS



AF103.1 General. The following construction techniques are intended to resist radon entry and prepare the building for post-construction radon mitigation, . if necessary (see Figure AF102). These techniques are required in areas where desig�nated by the jurisdiction.
AF103.2 Subfloor preparation. A layer of gas-permeable material shall be placed under all concrete slabs and other floor systems that directly contact the ground and are within the walls of the living spaces of the building, to facilitate future installation of a subslab depressurization system, if needed.

en The EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey have evaluated the radon potential in the United States and have developed a map of radon zones designed to assist building officials in deciding whether radon�6 resistant features are applicable in new construction.
m
The map assigns each of the 3,141 counties in the United States to one of three zones based on radon potential. Each zone designation reflects the average short-term radon measurement that can b
e expected to be measured in a building without the implementation of radon-control methods. The radon zone designation of highest priority is Zone 1. Table AFIOl lists the Zone 1 counties illustrated on the map.
