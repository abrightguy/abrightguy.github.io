For Methods CS-WSP and CS-SFB, the minimum panel length shall be based on the adjacent clear opening height in accordance with Table R602.10.5 and Figure R602.10.5. When a panel has an opening on either side of differing heights, the taller opening height shall be used to determine the panel length.
Contributing length. For purposes of computing the required length of bracing in Tables R602.10.3(1) and R602.10.3(3), the contributing length of each braced wall panel shall be as specified in Table
R602.10.5.2 Partial credit. For Methods DWB, WSP, SFB, PBS, PCP and HPS in Seismic Design Categories A, B and C, panels between 36 inches and 48 inches (914 mm and 1219 mm)) in length shall be considered a braced wall panel and shall be permitted to partially contribute toward the required length of bracing in Tables R602.10.3(1) andR602.10.3(3), and the contrib≠number of continuously sheathed portal frame panels in a single braced wall line shall not exceed four.


R602.10.6.5 Wall bracing for dwellings with stone and masonry veneer in Seismic Design Categories D0, D1 and D2ï Where stone and masonry veneer are installed in accordance with Section R703.7, wall brac≠ing on exterior braced wall lines and braced wall lines on the interior of the building, backing or perpendicular to and laterally supporting veneered walls shall comply with this section.
Where dwellings in Seismic Design Categories D0, D1 and D2 have stone or masonry veneer installed in
accordance with Section R703.7, and the veneer does not exceed the first-story height, wall bracing shall be in accordance with Section R602.10.3.
Where detached one-or two-family dwellings in Seismic Design Categories D0, D1 and D2 have stone or masonry veneer installed in accordance with Section R703.7, and the veneer exceeds the first-story height, wall bracing at exterior braced wall lines and braced wall lines on the interior of the building shall be con≠structed using Method BV-WSP in accordance with this section and Figure R602.10.6.5. Cripple walls shall not be permitted, and required interior braced wall lines shall be supported on continuous founda≠tions.
Townhouses in Seismic Design Categories D0, D1 and D2 with stone or masonry veneer exceeding the first-story height shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice. R602.10.6.5.1 Length of bracing. The length of bracing along each braced wall line shall be the greater of that required by the design wind speed and braced wall line spacing in accordance with Table R602.10.3(1) as adjusted by the factors in the Table R602.10.3(2) or the Seismic Design Category and braced wall line length in accordance with Table R602.10.6.5. Angled walls shall be permitted to be counted in accordance with Section R602.10.1.4, and braced wall panel location shall be in accor≠dance with Section R602.10.2.2. The seismic adjust≠ment factors in Table R602.10.3(4) shall not be applied to the length of bracing determined using Table R602.10.6.5. In no case shall the minimum total length of bracing in a braced wall line, after all adjustments have been taken, be less than 48 inches (1219 mm) total.

R602.10.7 Ends of braced wall lines with continuous
sheathing. Each end of a braced wall line with continuous
sheathing shall have one of the conditions shown in Figure

TABLE R603.7(2)



R603.9.1 Sheathing materials. Structural sheathing pan≠els shall consist of minimum 7/16-inch-thick (11 mm) ori≠ented strand board or 15/32-inch-thick (12 mm) plywood.
R603.9.2 Determination of minimum length of full height sheathing. The minimum length of full height sheathing on each braced wall line shall be determined by multiplying the length of the braced wall line by the per≠centage obtained from Table R603.9.2(1) and by the plan aspect-ratio adjustment factors obtained from Table R603.9.2(2). The minimum length of full height sheathing shall not be less than 20 percent of the braced wall line length.
To be considered full height sheathing, structural sheathing shall extend from the bottom to the top of the wall without interruption by openings. Only sheathed, full height wall sections, uninterrupted by openings, which are a minimum of 48 inches (1219 mm) wide, shall be counted toward meeting the minimum percentages in Table R603.9.2(1). In addition, structural sheathing shall comply with all of the following requirements:
31 1 WALL CONSTRUCTION

1.
Be installed with the long dimension parallel to the stud framing (i.e., vertical orientation) and shall cover the full vertical height of wall from the bottom of the bottom track to the top of the top track of each story. Installing the long dimension perpendicular to the stud framing or using shorter segments shall be permitted provided that the horizontal joint is blocked as described in Item 2.

2.
Be blocked when the long dimension is installed perpendicular to the stud framing (i.e., horizontal orientation). Blocking shall be a minimum of 33 mil


(0.84 mm) thickness. Each horizontal structural sheathing panel shall be fastened with No. 8 screws spaced at 6 inches (152 mm) on center to the block≠ing at the joint.
3. Be applied to each end (comers) of each of the exte≠rior walls with a minimum 48-inch-wide (1219 mm) panel.
R603.9.2.1 Full height sheathing. The minimum per≠centage of full-height structural sheathing shall be mul≠tiplied by 1.10 for 9-foot-high (2743 mm) walls and multiplied by 1.20 for 10-foot-high (3048 mm) walls.
R603.9.2.2 Full height sheathing in hip roof homes.
For hip roofed homes, the minimum percentages of full
height sheathing in Table R603.9.2(1), based upon
wind, shall be permitted to be multiplied by a factor of
0.95 for roof slopes not exceeding 7:12 and a factor of
0.9 for roof slopes greater than 7:12.
R603.9.2.3 Full height sheathing in lowest story. In the lowest story of a dwelling, multiplying the percent≠age of full height sheathing required in Table R603.9.2(1) by 0.6, shall be permitted provided hold down anchors are provided in accordance with Section R603.9.4.2.
R603.9.3 Structural sheathing fastening. All edges and interior areas of structural sheathing panels shall be fas≠tened to framing members and tracks in accordance with

For continuously-sheathed braced wall
lines using wood structural panels installed with No. 8 screws spaced 4-inches (102 mm) on center at all panel edges and 12 inches (304.8 mm) on center on intermediate framing members, the following shall apply:
1.
Multiplying the percentages of full height sheathing in Table R603.9.2(1) by 0.72 shall be permitted.

2.
For bottom track attached to foundations or framing below, the bottom track anchor or screw connection spacing in Table R505.3.1(1) and Table R603.3.1 shall be multiplied by two-thirds.



R603.9.4 Uplift connection requirements. Uplift con≠nections shall be provided in accordance with this section.

R611. 7 Solid walls for resistance to lateral forces.
R611.7.1 Length of solid wall. Each exterior wall line in each story shall have a total length of solid wall required by Section R6 11.7.1.1. A solid wall is a section of flat, waffle-grid or screen-grid wall, extending the full story height without openings or penetrations, except those per≠mitted by Section R611.7.2. Solid wall segments that con≠tribute to the total length of solid wall shall comply with Section R611.7.2.
R611.7.1.1 Length of solid wall for wind. All build≠ings shall have solid walls in each exterior endwall line (the side of a building that is parallel to the span of the roof or floor framing) and sidewall line (the side of a building that is perpendicular to the span of the roof or floor framing) to resist lateral in-plane wind forces. The site-appropriate basic wind speed and exposure cate≠gory shall be used in Tables R611.7(1A) through (I C) to determine the unreduced total length, UR, of solid wall required in each exterior endwall line and sidewall line. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet (10 668 mm), the unreduced values determined from Tables R611.7(1A) though (lC) is permitted by multiplying by the applicable factor, R1, from Table R611.7(2); however, reduced values shall not be less than the minimum values in Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC). Where the floor-to-ceiling height of a story is less than 10 feet (3048 mm), the unreduced val≠ues determined from Tables R611.7(1A) through (C), including minimum values, is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R2, from Table R611.7(3). To account for different design strengths than assumed in determining the values in Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC), the unreduced lengths deter≠mined from Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC), includ≠ing minimum values, are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable factor, R3, from Table R611.7(4). The reductions permitted by Tables R611.7(2), R611.7(3) and R611.7(4) are cumulative.
The total length of solid wall segments, TL, in a wall line that comply with the minimum length requirements of Section R611.7.2.1 [see Figure R611.7(1)] shall be equal to or greater than the product of the unreduced length of solid wall from Tables R611.7(1A) through (lC), UR and the applicable reduction factors, if any, from Tables R611.7(2), R611.7(3) and R611.7(4) as indicated by Equation R6-l.

The total length of solid wall in a wall line, TL, shall
not be less than that provided by two solid wall seg≠
ments complying with the minimum length require≠
ments of Section R611.7.2.1.


To facilitate determining the required wall thickness,
wall type, number and grade of vertical bars at the each
end of each solid wall segment, and whether shear rein≠

R611.7.2 Solid wall segments. Solid wall segments that contribute to the required length of solid wall shall comply with this section. Reinforcement shall be provided in accordance with Section R611.7.2.2 and Table R611.7(4). Solid wall segments shall extend the full story-height without openings, other than openings for the utilities and other building services passing through the wall. In flat walls and waffle-grid walls, such openings shall have an area of less than 30 square inches (19 355 mm2) with no

between horizontal and vertical cores of concrete and opening size and location are not restricted provided no concrete is removed.

R611.7.2.1 Minimum length of solid wall segment and maximum spacing. Only solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length shall be included in the total length of solid wall required by Section R611. 7 .1. In addition, no more than two solid wall segments equal to or greater than 24 inches (610 mm) in length and less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in length shall be included in the required ()total length of solid wall. The maximum clear opening width shall be 18 feet (5486 mm). See Figure R611.7(1).

a.
Tabulated lengths were derived by calculating design wind pressures in accordance with Figure 6-10 of ASCE 7 for a building with a mean roof height of 35 feet. For wind perpendicular to the ridge, the effects of a 2-foot overhang on each endwall are included. The design pressures were used to calculate forces to be resisted by solid wall segments in each endwall [Table R611.7(1A) or R611. 7(1B) or sidewall (Table R611. 7(1 C)], as appropriate. The forces to be resisted by each wall line were then divided by the default design strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of length to determine the required solid wall length. The actual mean roof height of the building shall not exceed the least horizontal dimension of the building.

b.
Tabulated lengths in the "minimum" coluum are based on the requirement of Section 6. 1.4. 1 of ASCE 7 that the main windforce-resisting system be designed for a minimum service level force of 10 psf multiplied by the area of the building projected onto a vertical plane normal to the assumed wind direction. Tabulated lengths in shaded cells are less than the "minimum" value. Where the minimum controls, it is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Notes c, d and e. See Section R611.7.1.1.

c.
For buildings with a mean roof height of less than 35 feet, tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the appropriate factor, R, from


1

Table R611.7(2). The reduced length shall not be less than the "minimum" value shown in the table.
d.
Tabulated lengths for "one story or top story of two story" are based on a floor-to-ceiling height of 10 feet. Tabulated lengths for "first story of two story" are based on floor-to-ceiling heights of 10 feet each for the first and second story. For floor-to-ceiling heights less than assumed, use the lengths in Table R611.7(1A), (lB) or (lC), or multiply the value in the table by the reduction factor, R2, from Table R611.7(3).

e.
Tabulated lengths are based on the default design shear strength of 840 pounds per linear foot of solid wall segment. The tabulated lengths are permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the applicable reduction factor for design strength, R3, from Table R611.7(4).

f.
The reduction factors, R1, R2 andR3, in Tables R611.7(2), R611.7(3), and R611.7(4), respectively, are permitted to be compounded, subject to the limitations of Note b. However, the minimum number and minimum length of solid walls segments in each wall line shall comply with Sections R611.7.1 and R611.7.2.1, respectively.

g.
For intermediate values of sidewall length, endwall length, roof slope and basic wind speed, use the next higher value, or determine by interpolation.
