. __/
ically adjusts the luminous flux of the electric lighting sys�
tem in response.















Automatic multilevel daylight control adjusts the lumi�nous flux of the electric lighting system in either a series of steps or by continuous dimming in response to available daylight. This kind of control uses one or more photosensors to detect changes in daylight illumination and then automatically adjusts the electric lighting levels in response.
Automatic time switch control controls lighting based on the time of day.
Captive-key override is a type of lighting control in which the key that activates the override cannot be released when the lights are in the on position.
Countdown timer switch turns lighting or other loads ON when activated using one or more selectable count-down time periods and then automatically turns lighting or other loads OFF when the selected time period had elapsed.
Dimmer varies the luminous flux of the electric lighting system by changing the power delivered to that lighting sys�tem.
Dimmer, full-range (Also known as a continuous dimmer) varies the luminous flux of the electric lighting system over a continuous range from the device's maximum light output to the device's minimum light output without visually apparent abrupt changes in light level between the various steps.
Dimmer, stepped varies the luminous flux of the electric lighting system in one or more predetermined discrete steps between maximum light output and OFF with changes in lightlevel between adjacent steps being visually apparent.
Lighting control, self-contained is a unitary lighting con�trol module that requires no additional components to be a fully functional lighting control.
