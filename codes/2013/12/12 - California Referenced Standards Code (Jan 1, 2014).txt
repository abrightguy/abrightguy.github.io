PREFACE 

This document is Part 12 of 12 parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to the California Code ofRegulations, Title 24, also refelTed to as the Califor­nia Building Standards Code. This part is known as the California Referenced Standards Code. 
The Cal~lornia Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legisla­ture, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various state agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building regulations, or standards, have the same force oflaw, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless oth­erwise stipulated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as anno­tated. 
A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings ofthe local condition(s) and the adopted local bujlding standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effec­tive sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing.

INTRODUCTION 

SECTION 12-3-1 
SCOPE 

12-3-1.1 These requirements cover releasing systems for bars, grilles, mesh, glazing or other items intended to provide secu­rity at doors and windows required for emergency escape from dwelling units. When actuated by the occupant, the system allows the obstructions over the door or window to be moved so occupants can escape in the event of an emergency. 
12-3-1.2 These requirements only cover the ability of the releasing system to be manually activated from the interior of a dwelling unit by an occupant to effect an escape through the protected opening. 
12-3-1.3 These requirements cover releasing systems intended for use on the interior side of doors or windows in all climatic locations. 
12·3·1.4 These requirements do not evaluate the ability of the releasing system or obstructions to resist an external forced entry attack. 
12-3-1.5 These requirements do not evaluate the ability of the releasing system or obstructions to be opened or removed from the exterior of the residential dwelling unit by emergency response personnel during rescue operations. 
12-3-1.6 Products covered by these requirements are intended for installation in dwelling units to protect door and window openings that are designated by the California Building Stan­dards Code to be used as the secondary means of escape from the living area. 
12-3-1.7 Products covered by these requirements are not intended to be used to protect doors in means of egress path for nonresidential occupancies, the common egress path of multi­family residential dwelling units or the primary means of egress path in a single-family dwelling unit. 
12-3-1.8 These requirements do not cover window guards or fall prevention devices that are intended to prevent falls from upper story windows. 
12-3-1.9 These requirements do not apply to storm doors and windows or light duty screens used for insect controL 
12-3-1.10 A product that contains features, characteristics, components, or materials new or different from those covered by these requirements, and that involve a risk of fIre, electric shock, or injury to persons shall be evaluated using the appro­priate additional component and end-product requirements as determined necessary to maintain an acceptable level of safety. 
SECTION 12-3-2 
GENERAL 

12-3-2.1 Components. 
12-3-2.1.1 Except as indicated in Section 12-3-2.1.2, a com­ponent of a product covered shall comply with the require­ments for that component. 
12-3-2.1.2 A component need not comply with a specific requirement that: 
(a) 
Involves a feature or characteristic not needed in the application of the component in the product covered by these requirements, or 

(b) 
Is superseded by these requirements. 


12-3-2.1.3 A component shall be used in accordance with its recognized rating established for the intended conditions of use. 
12-3-2.1.4 SpecifIc components are recognized as being incomplete in construction features or restricted in perfor­mance capabilities. Such components are intended for use only under limited conditions, such as certain temperatures not exceeding specific limits, and shall be used only under those specific conditions for which they have been recognized. 
12-3-2.2 Units of measurement. 
12-3-2.2.1 When a value for measurement is followed by a value in other units in parentheses, the first stated value is the requirement. 
12-3-2.3 Installation instructions. 
12-3-2.3.1 A copy of the operating and installation instruc­tions or equivalent information is to be furnished with the samples submitted for investigation for use as a guide in the examination and test of the mechanism. For this purpose, a printed edition is not required. 
12-3-2.4 Definitions. 
12-3-2.4.1 Dwelling unit. A single unit, providing com­plete, independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation. 
12-3-2.4.2 Escape. For the purposes of these requirements, escape refers to movement of occupants from the interior of a residential dwelling unit to a safe point outside of the dwelling unit during an emergency fire condition. 
12-3-2.4.3 Emergency means of escape. A passage inde­pendent of and remote from the primary means of escape that provides a means of travel from living and sleeping spaces inside a dwelling unit to the outside. 
12-3-2.4.4 Means of escape. A concept included in build­ing codes that, in most cases, requires sleeping rooms and living areas in dwelling units to be provided with at least one primary means of escape and one secondary means of escape to the outside. 
12-3-2.4.5 Primary means of escape. A door, stairway or ramp providing a means of unobstructed travel from living spaces inside a dwelling unit to the outside at street or ground leveL 
12-3-2.4.6 Security bars. For the purposes of these require­ments, the term "security bars" includes "burglar bars" and refers to metal and other bars, grilles, grates and other barri­ers that are designed to provide security for doors and win­dows in dwelling units. The purpose of security bars, by their mere presence on a building, is to deter a potential forced entry into the dwelling. 
CONSTRUCTION 

SECTION 12-3-3

CHAPTER 12-7-1 
FIRE-RESISTIVE STANDARDS 

FIRE TESTS OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS 
STANDARD 12-7-1 

STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
SCOPE 

Sec. 12-7-100. 
(a) 
This standard for fire tests contains methods that are applicable to assemblies of masonry units and to composite assemblies of structural materials for buildings, including bearing and other walls and partitions, columns, girders, beams, slabs, and composite slab and beam assemblies for floors and roofs. They are also applicable to other assemblies and structural units that constitute permanent integral parts of a finished bUilding. 

(b) 
It is the intent that classifications shall register perfor­mance during the period of exposure and shall not be construed as having determined suitability for use after exposure. 


FIRE TESTING FURNACES AND CONTROL 
Sec. 12-7-101. Fire testing furnaces and their control shall con­form to SFM 12-7 -1, Fire Testing Furnaces. 
UNEXPOSED SURFACE TEMPERATURES 
Sec. 12-7-102. 
(a) 
Thermocouples. Temperatures of unexposed surfaces shall be measured with thermocouples placed under flexible, oven-dry, felted asbestos pads, 6 inches square, 0.4 inch in thickness, and weighing not less than 1.0 nor more than 1.4 pounds per square foot. The pads shall be sufficiently soft so that, without breaking, they may be shaped to contact over the whole surface against which they are placed. The wire leads of the thermocouple shall have an immersion under the pad and be in contact with the unexposed surface for not less than 31/2 inches. The hot junction of the thermocouple shall be placed approximately under the center of the pad. The outside diame­ter of protecting or insulating tubes shall not be more than 5116 inch. The pad shall be held firmly against the surface and shall fit closely about the thermocouples. The wires for the thermo­couple in the length covered by the pad shall be not heavier than No. 18 B.&S. gage (0.04 inch) and shall be electrically insu­lated and heat-and moisture-resistant coatings. 

Note: In tests of assemblies with roof coverings, the thermocouples and pads shall be placed on top of the roof covering. 

(b) 
Ceiling-floor, ceiling-roof assemblies. Temperature readings shall be taken in the center of the plenum, on the bot­tom side of the Hoor or roof deck, and on the structural mem­bers in fire-endurance tests of ceiling-floor and ceiling-roof assemblies. Thermocouples shall be located on structural steel 


as specified in Section 12-7-11 0 (c). In combustible assemblies five or more thermocouples shall be located on the bottom of soffit of joists or beams. Thermocouples shall be placed in rep­resentative locations such as at midspan, over joints in the ceil­ing, over light fixtures, over air-outlet openings or similar locations. 
(c) 
Thermocouple locations on unexposed side. Tempera­ture readings shall be taken at not less than nine points on the surface of the unexposed side. Five of these shall be symmetri­cally disposed, one to be approximately at the center of the specimen and four at approximately the center of its quarter sections. The other four shall be located at the discretion of the testing authority to obtain representative information on the performance of the construction under test. None of the thermocouples shall be located nearer than 11/2 times the thick­ness of the construction, or nearer than 12 inches to the edges. An exception shall be made in those cases where there is an ele­ment of the construction at the edges which is not otherwise represented in the remainder of the construction. Also, none of the thermocouples shall be located opposite or on top ofbeams, girders, pilasters, or other structural members if temperatures at such points will obviously be lower than at other more repre­sentative locations. 

(d) 
Temperature intervals. Temperature readings shall be taken at intervals not exceeding 15 minutes until a reading exceeding 212°F (lOO°C) has been obtained at anyone point. Thereafter the readings may be taken more frequently at the discretion of the testing body, but the intervals need not be less than five minutes. 

(e) 
Maximum unexposed temperature rise. Where the conditions of acceptance place a limitation on the rise of tem­perature of the unexposed surface, the temperature end point of the fire endurance period shall be determined by the average of the measurements taken at individual points; except that if a temperature rise 30 percent in excess of the specified limit occurs at anyone of these points, the remainder shall be ignored and the fire endurance period judged as ended. 


CLASSIFICATION AS DETERMINED BY TEST 
Sec. 12-7-103. 
(a) Fire exposure report. Results shall be reported in accor­dance with the performance tests prescribed in these methods. They shall be expressed in time periods of resistance, to the nearest integral minute. Reports shall include observations of significant details of behavior of the material or construction during the test and after the furnace fire is cut off, including information on deformation, spalling, cracking, burning of the specimen or its component parts, continuance of flaming and production of smoke. The fonn and contents of reports shall be in accordance with Section 12-7-115. 
(b) Structural tire report. Reports of tests involving wall, ceiling-floor, ceiling-roof or beam constructions in which restraint is provided against expansion, contraction or rotation of the construction shall describe the method used to provide this restraint and include details ofthe restraining frame as well as infonnation recorded during the test concerning the forces imposed on that structure by the test specimen. 
TEST SPECIMEN 
Sec. 12-7·104. 
(a) 
Representative specimen. The test specimen shall be truly representative of the construction for which classification is desired, as to materials, workmanship and details such as dimensions of parts, and shall be built under conditions repre­sentative of those obtaining as practically applied in building construction and operations. The physical properties of the materials and ingredients used in the test specimen shall be determined and recorded. When necessary for evaluation of test reports, the sponsor shall furnish them to the enforcing agency. 

(b) 
Specimen size. The size and dimensions of the test speci­men specified herein are intended to apply for rating construc­tions ofdimensions within the usual general range employed in bUildings. If the conditions of use limit the construction to smaller dimensions, a proportionate reduction may be made in the dimensions of the specimens for a test qualifying them for such restricted use. 


DURATION AND CONDUCT OF TESTS 
Sec. 12·7·105. 
(a) 
Fire endurance. The fire endurance test on the specimen with its applied load, if any, shall be continued until failure occurs, or until the specimen has withstood the test conditions for a period equal to that herein specified in the conditions of acceptance for the given type of construction. 

(b) 
Hose stream test. Where required by the conditions of acceptance, a duplicate sample shall be subjected to a fire expo­sure test for a period equal to one-half of that indicated as the resistance period in the fire endurance test, but not for more than one hour, immediately after which the sample shall be subjected to the impact, erosion, and cooling effects of a hose stream directed first at the middle and then at all parts of the exposed face, changes in direction being made slowly. 

(c) 
Exemption. The hose stream shall not be required in the case of constructions having a resistance period, indicated in the fire endurance test, of less than one hour. 

(d) 
Optional program. The submitter may elect, with the advice and consent of the testing body, to have the hose stream test made on the sample subjected to the fire endurance test and immediately following the expiration ofthe fire endurance test. 

(e) 
Stream equipment and details. The stream shall be delivered through i Irinch hose, discharging through a National Standard Play Pipe of corresponding size equipped 


11
with a / 8-inch discharge tip of the standard-taper, smooth-bore pattern without shoulder at the orifice. The water pressure and duration of application shall be as specified in Table SFM 12-7-1A. 
(f) 
Nozzle distance. The nozzle orifice shall be 20 feet from the center ofthe exposed surface ofthe test sample ifthe nozzle is so located that, when directed at the center, its axis is nonnal to the surface of the test sample. If otherwise located, its distance from the center shall be less than 20 feet by an amount equal to 1 foot for each 10 degrees of deviation from the nonnaL 

(g) 
Protection and conditioning oftest specimen. The test specimen shall be protected during and after fabrication to ensure nonnality of its quality and condition at the time of test. Itshall not be tested until a large portion of its final strength has been attained, and, if it contains moisture, until the excess has been removed to achieve an air-dry condition in accordance with the requirements given in Items 1 through 3. The testing equipment and sample undergoing the fire test shall be pro­tected from any condition of wind or weather that might lead to abnonnal results. The ambient air temperature at the beginning of the test shall be within the range of 50 to 90°F (10 to 32°C). The velocity of air across the unexposed surface of the sample, measured just before the test begins, shall not exceed 4.4 feet per second, as detennined by an anemometer placed at right angles to the unexposed surface. If mechanical ventilation is employed during the test, an air stream shall not be directed across the surface of the specimen. 


1. 	
Prior to the fire test, constructions shall be conditioned with the objective of providing, within a reasonable time, a moisture condition within the specimen approx­imately representative of that likely to exist in similar constructions in buildings. For purposes ofstandardiza­tion, this condition is to be considered as that which would be established at equilibrium resulting from dry­ing in an ambient atmosphere of 50 percent relative humidity at 73°P' However, with some constructions, it may be difficult or impossible to achieve such unifor­mity within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, where this is the case, specimens may be tested when the dampest portion of the structure, the portion at 6-inch depth below the surface of massive construc­tions, has achieved a moisture content corresponding to drying to eqUilibrium with air in the range of 50 to 75 percent relative humidity at 73 ± 5°P' In the event that specimens dried in a heated building fail to meet these requirements after a 12-month conditioning period, or in the event that the nature of the construction is such that it is evident that drying of the specimen interior will be prevented by hennetic sealing, these requirements may be waived, except as to attainment of a large por­tion of final strength, and in the specimen tested in the condition in which it then exists. 

2. 
Specimens shall be exposed to the controlled condi­tions outlined in Item 1 until the interior or dampest sec­tion of the assembly attains a relative humidity of 75 percent or less. Ifduring the conditioning of the speci­men it appears desirable or is necessary to use acceler­ated drying techniques, it is the responsibility of the 


laboratory conducting the test to avoid procedures which will significantly alter the structural or fire endurance characteristics of the specimen or both from those produced as the result of drying in accordance with procedures given in Item 1. 
3. Within 72 hours prior to the fire test, infonnation on the actual moisture content and distribution within the specimen shall be obtained. This infonnation shall be included in the test report.

Application. This test procedure does not require col­umn loading at any time and may be used at the discretion of the testing laboratory to evaluate steel column protections that are not required by design to carry any of the column load. 

(b) 
Size and character of sample. 


1. 	
The size ofthe steel column used shall be such as to pro­vide a test specimen that is truly representative of the design, materials and workmanship for which classifi­cation is desired. The protection shall be applied according to the methods of acceptable field practice. The length of the protected column shall be at least 8 feet. The column shall be vertical during application of the protection and during the fire exposure. The rating of performance shall not be applicable to sizes of col­umns smaller than those tested. 

2. 	
The applied protection shall be restrained against longi­tudinal temperature expansion greater than that of the steel column by rigid steel plates or reinforced concrete attached to the ends of the steel column before the pro­tection is applied. The size of the plates or amount of concrete shall be adequate to provide direct bearing for the entire transverse area of the protection. 

3. 	
The ends of the specimen, including the means for restraint, shall be given sufficient thermal insulation to prevent appreciable direct heat transfer from the furnace. 


(c) 
Temperature measurement. The temperature of the steel in the column shall be measured by at least three thermocouples located at each of four levels. The upper and lower levels shall be 2 feet from the ends of the steel column, and the other two intermediate levels shall be equally spaced. The thermocouples at each level shall be so placed as to mea­sure significant temperatures ofthe component elements of the steel section. 

(d) 
Exposure to fire. During the fire endurance test, the specimen shall be exposed to fire on all sides for its full length. 

(e) 
Conditions of acceptance. The test shall be regarded as successful if the transmission of heat through the protection during the period of fire exposure for which classification is desired does not raise the average (arithmetical) temperature of the thermocouples at anyone of the four levels above 1000°F (537.8°C), or does not raise the temperature above 1200°F (648.8°C) at anyone of the measured points. 


TESTS OF FLOORS AND ROOFS 
Sec. 12-7-110. (The following is applicable to floors and roofs with or without attached, furred or suspended ceilings, and requires application of fire exposure to the underside of the construction.) 
(a) Size and construction of sample. 
1. 	The area exposed to fire shall be not less than 180 square feet, with neither dimension less than 12 feet. 
Structural members, if a part of the construction under test, shall lie within the combustion chamber and have a clearance of not less than 8 inches from its walls. No individual classification shall be made of structural members which have a clearance of less than 24 inches from its walls. The fire testing furnace, its arrangement and control during fire tests shall conform to the provi­sions of SFM 12-7-3, Section 12-7-301 (c), for Hori­zontal Large-scale Floor Furnace. 
2. 	Structural members forming a part of the assembly shall be supported in accordance with the recom­mended fabrication procedures for the type ofconstruc­tion. Assemblies representing forms of construction that restrain structural elements and top deck shall be supported by a restraining frame, incorporated in or attachable to the furnace structure in such a manner that comparable restraint shall occur during the test. 
(b) 
Loading. Throughout the fire endurance test, a superim­posed load shall be applied to the test specimen. This load, together with the weight of the specimen, shall be as nearly as practicable the maximum theoretical dead and live loads per­mitted by nationally recognized design standards. 

(c) 
Temperature measurement. The temperature of the steel in structural members shall be measured by thermocouples at three or more sections equally spaced along the length of the members with one section located at mid-span; alternately when thermocouples are placed at four sections, they may be at the quarter points provided no thermocouples shall be placed within 24 inches of the furnace walls; except that in cases where the cover thickness is not uni­form along the specimen length, at least one of these sections shall include the point of minimum cover. For solid section steel beams, there shall be four thermocouples at each section: one at the center on the exposed face of the bottom flange, one on the edge of the bottom flange, one on the web at the center and one on the bottom at the edge of the top flange. For rein­forced or prestressed concrete structural members, thermocouples shall be located on each ofthe tension reinforc­ing elements unless there are more than eight elements, in which case thermocouples shall be placed on eight elements of selected in such a manner as to obtain representative tempera­tures of all the elements. For designs employing trusses or open-web steel joists, four thermocouples shall preferably be placed at mid-span of each truss or joist, two on the bottom chord, one at the middle of the web element and one on the bot­tom ofthe top chord with locations selected in such a manner as to obtain representative temperatures of all the elements, pro­vided, however, that no more than four joists need to be so instrumented. For designs employing combustible framing, three or more thermocouples shall be placed approximately at mid-span on three or more framing members and so located as to obtain representative temperatures on the soffits of the fram­ing members. 

(d) 
Conditions of acceptance. In obtaining an assembly classification, the following conditions shall be met:

2. 	
The transmission of heat through the construction dur­ing the fire endurance test shall not have been such as to raise the average temperature of the thermocouples on its unexposed surface more than 150°F (139°C) above its initial temperature. 

3. 	
Structural failure, deflection or sagging ofthe structural elements of the test specimen or any portion of the structural elements in excess of 12 inches shall be judged as the end of the fire endurance period. 

4. 
For assemblies employing steel structural members, including decks designed as structural diaphragms the transmission of heat through the protection during the period of fire endurance for which classification is desired does not raise the temperature at any location on the member above 1200°F, nor the average of the thermocouples at any section above 1000°F. 

5. 
For assemblies employing multiple open web steel joists (spaced less than 48 inches on center), the trans­mission ofheat through the protection during the period of fire endurance for which classification is desired does not raise the average of all thermocouples in all joists above 1000°F. 

6. 	
For assemblies employing concrete structural mem­bers, the transmission of heat through the cover to the steel during the period for which classification is desired does not raise the average temperature of the thermocouples at any section on the steel above 800°F for cold drawn prestressing steel or 1OOO°F for reinforc­ing steel. 


(e) 
Reports of results. The fire endurance shall be reported for the floor or roof assembly as tested, and a different fire endurance classification from that of the assembly for struc­tural members shall not be recorded without reference to Sec­tion 12-7-110 (f) and (g). 

(f) 
Alternate classification procedure for loaded struc­tural frame members. Fire endurance classifications may be developed for structural frame members tested as part ofa floor or roof assembly as described in Section 12-7-110 (a) through 

(c) 
using the conditions of acceptance described in Section 12-7-110 (g). The fire endurance classification so derived shall be applicable to the structural frame member when used with any floor or roof construction which has a comparable or greater thermal capacity for heat dissipation from the beam, and equal or greater compressive strength than the floor or roof with which it was tested. The fire-resistance classification developed by this method shall not be applicable to sizes of structural frame members smaller than those tested.

FIRE-RESISTIVE STANDARDS 
of fire endurance for which classification is desired does not raise the temperature at any location on the member above 1200°F, nor the average temperature recorded by four thermocouples at any section above 1000°F. 
3. 	
For assemblies employing open-web steeljoists or steel trusses spaced 4 feet or more on centers, the transmis­sion of heat through the protection on the steel joists or trusses during the period of fire endurance for which classification is desired does not raise the average tem­perature of all joists or truss thermocouples above 1 000 oF. 

4. 
For assemblies employing concrete structural members the transmission of heat through the cover to the steel during the period for which classification is desired does not raise the average temperature of the thermocouples at any section on the steel above 800°F for cold drawn prestressing steel or 1000°F for reinforc­ing steel.

(a) Thermocouples. 
1. 	
Furnace thermocouples shall be protected by sealed porcelain tubes having 3/4-inch outside diameter and 

18-inch wall thickness, or, as an alternate, in the case of base-metal thermocouples, shall be protected by l/rinch wrought steel or wrought iron pipe of standard weight or equivalent protection of approved type. The exposed length of the pyrometer tube and thermocouple in the furnace chamber shall be not less than 12 inches. 

2. 	
In the large-scale horizontal floor and vertical wall fur­naces, the temperature of the fire test exposure shall be deemed to be the average temperature obtained from the readings of not less than nine thermocouples sym­metrically disposed and distributed to show the temper­ature near all parts of the test specimen. In the vertical half scale and horizontal small-scale furnaces, the num­ber of thermocouples shall be proportioned to those of the large-scale furnaces, but shall in no case be less than four thermocouples. 

3. 	
In the column furnace, the temperature of the fire test exposure shall be deemed to be the average temperature obtained from the readings of not less than eight thermocouples symmetrically disposed at two levels to show the temperature near all parts of the test specimen. The two levels shall be located approximately 2 feet from the top and bottom of an 8-foot clear height furnace. 

4. 
In the vertical wall furnaces, 	the junction of the thermocouples shall be placed 6 inches from the exposed face ofthe test specimen at the beginning ofthe test The junction of the thermocouples shall, during the fire test and as a result of deflection, be maintained at 6 inches from the exposed face of the test specimen. 

5. 	
In horizontal beam, floor and roof furnaces having a furnace chamber not less than 180 square feet in area, the junction of the thermocouples shall be 12 inches from the exposed face of the test specimen at the begin­ning of the test, and shall not touch the test specimen during the test as a result of its deflection. 

6. 	
In horizontal beam, floor and roof furnaces having a furnace chamber less than 180 square feet in area, the junction of the thermocouples shall be placed 6 inches from the exposed face of the test specimen at the begin­ning of the test and, during the test, shall not touch the test specimen as a result of its deflection. 


(b) Temperature recording. The furnace temperatures shall be read at intervals not exceeding 5 minutes during the first 2 hours, and thereafter the intervals may be increased to not more than 10 minutes. 
(c) 
Furnace control accuracy_ The accuracy of the furnace control shall be such that the area under the time-temperature curve, obtained by averaging the results from the thermocouple readings, is within 10 percent of the corresponding area under the standard time-temperature curve for fire tests of 1 hour or less duration, within 7.5 percent for those over 1 hour and not more than 2 hours, and within 5 percent for tests exceeding 2 hours in duration. Individual thermocouple readings shall not exceed or fall below the standard time-temperature curve by more than 15 percent. 

(d) 
Furnace correction. When the indicated resistance period is 1/z hour or over, determined by the average or maxi­mum temperature rise on the unexposed surface or within the test sample, or by failure under load, a correction shall be applied for variation of the furnace exposure from that pre­scribed, where it will affect the classification, by multiplying the indicated period by two-thirds of the difference in area between the curve ofaverage furnace temperature and the stan­dard curve for the first three-fourths of the period and dividing the product by the area between the standard curve and a base line of 60°F (20°C) for the same part of the indicated period, the latter area increased by 54 Fahr-hour or 30 Cent-hour (3240 Fahr-minutes or 1800 Cent-minutes) to compensate for the thermal lag of the furnace thermocouples during the first part of the test. For fire exposure in the test higher than standard, the indicated resistance period shall be increased by the amount of the correction and be similarly decreased for fire exposure below standard. 


Note: The correction can be expressed by the following for­
mula:  
c =21(A  AS)  
3(AS+L)  
where:  

C 	correction in the same units as 1 
indicated fire endurance period 
A 	area under the curve of indicated average furnace tem­perature for the first three-fourths of the indicated period 
AS = area under the standard furnace curve for the same part of the indicated period 
L 	lag correction in the same units as A and AS (54 Fahr-hour or 30 Cent-hour (3240 Fahr-minutes or 1800 Cent-minutes) 
(e) Furnace pressure. The pressure in the furnace chamber during the fire test shall be maintained as nearly equal to atmo­spheric pressure as possible. Horizontal furnaces may be oper­ated at a slight negative pressure sufficient to reduce haze permitting visual observation. Furnace stacks shall be equipped with dampers to facilitate maintenance of furnace pressure. 
FIRE-RESISTIVE STANDARDS 
for heat dissipation, noncombustible assembly having an insu­lating concrete t100r or other type of
Sec. 12-7-305. Tests of specific assemblies of materials shall 
be conducted for correlation (or correlation factor) of furnace Comparison of test results shall provide evidence of equiva­
exposure by comparison with tests of identical assemblies and lent exposure based on transmitted temperatures on the unex­
materials conducted in furnaces of "Approved Listing Agen­posed side, on structural framing members, on the underside of 
cies" which furnaces are deemed as conforming to the design floor or roof decks, and in the plenum space. 
and operating requirements of this standard. 

Correlation tests of waH furnaces shaH include tests of two assemblies, one combustible and one noncombustible. 
Correlation tests of horizontal furnaces dependent on intended test specimens shall include at least one test for each type of assembly such as combustible ceiling-floor assembly, noncombustible assembly having a high thermal capacity floor

FIRE-RESISTIVE STANDARDS 

FIRE DOOR ASSEMBLY TESTS 
STANDARD 12-7-4 

STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
SCOPE 
Sec. 12-7-400. 
(a) 
Application. These methods offire tests are applicable to door assemblies of various materials and types of construction for use in wall openings to retard the passage of fire (flame, heat and smoke). 

(b) 
Performance. Tests made in conformity with these test methods will register performance during the test exposure, but such tests shall not be construed as determining suitability for use after exposure to fire. 

(
c) Suitability of assemblies. It is the intent that tests made in conformity with these test methods will develop data to enable enforcing agencies to determine the suitability of door assemblies for use in locations where fire resistance of a speci­fied duration is required. 


FIRE TESTING FURNACES AND CONTROL 
Sec. 12-7·401. 
(a) 
Furnaces. Fire testing furnaces and their control shall conform to SFM 12-7-3, Fire Testing Furnaces, Section 12-7-301 (a), Vertical Large-scale Wall Furnaces. 

(b) 
Half scale. If the proposed conditions of use limit the construction to smaller dimensions, and for the evaluation of hardware intended for use on doors not exceeding 4 feet in width by7 feet 2 inches in height, fire testing furnaces conform­ing to Section 12-7-301 (b), Vertical Half-scale Wall Furnace, may be utilized. Constructions and hardware for ceiling access doors intended for use in fire-endurance rated ceiling-floor assemblies shall be tested in furnaces conforming to SFM 12-7-3, Section 12-7-301 (b), (d) or (f). 


UNEXPOSED SURFACE TEMPERATURES 
Sec. 12-7-402. 
(a) 
Temperatures recorded. The unexposed surface tem­peratures of all fire door assemblies shall be recorded. The unexposed surface temperature shall be determined in the man­ner specified in Sections 12-7-402 (b), (c) and (d). 

(b) 
Surface temperature locations. Unexposed surface temperatures shall be taken at not less than three points, with at least one thermocouple in each 16 square foot area of the door(s). Thermocouples shall not be located over reinforce­ments extending through the door, over glass panels or nearer than 12 inches from the edge of the door. 


(c) Thermocouples. Unexposed surface temperatures shall be measured with thermocouples placed under flexible, oven-dry, felted asbestos pads of the following approximate dimensions and weight: 6 inches square, 0.40 inch in thickness, and weighing 0.026 pound. The pads shall be held firmly against the surface of the door(s) and shall fit closely about the thermocouples without breaking. The thermocouple leads shall be immersed under the pad for distance of not less than 
31 
/2 inches, with the hot junction under the center of the pad. The thermocouple leads under the pads shall be not heavier than No. 18 B.&S. gage (0.04 inch) and shall be electrically insulated with heat-resistant and moisture-resistant coatings. 
(d) Recording interval. Unexposed surface temperatures shall be read at the same intervals as used for the furnace tem­peratures, Section 12-7-304 (b). 
TEST ASSEMBLIES 
Sec. 12-7-403.

2. 	
A floor structure shall be provided as part of the open­ing to be protected, except where such floor interferes with the operation of the door. The floor segment shall be ofnoncombustible material and shall project into the furnace approximately twice the thickness of the test door. 


(b) Mounting of doors for test purposes. 
1. 	
Swinging doors shall be mounted so as to open into the furnace chamber, except doors in pairs swinging in opposite directions shall be mounted so as to have one door leaf open into and one door leaf open away from the furnace chamber. 

2. 	
Sliding and rolling doors, except passenger elevator shaft doors, shall be mounted on the exposed side of the opening in the wall closing the furnace chamber. 

3. 
Passenger elevator shaft doors shall be mounted on the unexposed side of the opening in the wall closing the furnace chamber. 


4. 
Access-type door and chute-type door and frame assemblies shall be mounted so as to have one assem­bly open into the furnace chamber and another assem­bly open away from the furnace chamber. Ceiling access doors and frame assemblies shall be mounted in a representative ceiling with the room side of the access door opening into the furnace chamber. 

5. 
Dumbwaiter and service counter door and frame assemblies shall be mounted on the exposed side of the opening in the walL 

6. 	
Door frames shall be evaluated when mounted so as to have the doors open either away from or into the fur­nace chamber at the discretion of the enforcing agency to obtain representative information on the performance of the construction under test. 

7.

The report shall show the performance under the desired exposure period chosen from the following: 20 min­utes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 11/2 hours or 3 hours. The report shall include the temperature mea­surements of the furnace, and, if determined, of the unexposed side of the test as sembI y. It shall also contain a record of all observations having a bearing on the per­formance of the test assembly. 


CONDITIONS OF ACCEPTANCE 
Sec. 12-7-406. 
(a) General. 
1. 	A door assembly shall be considered as meeting the requirements for acceptable performance when it remains in the opening during the tests specified in this standard within the limitations contained in this section for the desired endurance rating. 
2. 	
The test assembly shall have withstood the fire endur­ance test and hose stream test without developing open­ings anywhere through the assembly, except that dislodging of small fragments from the central area of the glass light shall be disregarded. The edges of the individual glass light shall remain in place. 

Exception: The hose stream test shall not be required for opposite swing double egress exit doors, and for doors of fire endurance rating of less than 45 minutes with or without approved wired glass lights. 

3.

12-7A-l.4 Definitions. 
1. 	
Siding (cladding). Any material that constitutes the exposed exterior covering of an exterior wall and is applied over sheathing or is directly attached to the wall structural system. 

2. 
Sheathing. The material placed 	on an exterior wall beneath cladding or siding and is directly attached to the wall structural system. 


12-7A-1.S Summary of test method. 
1. 	
Direct flame exposure. This test method provides for the direct flame exposure of a wall specimen to a flame source centered at the base of a 4-foot by 8-foot (1220 mm by 2440 mm) test assembly. 

2. 	
Gas burner. The method employs a gas burner to pro­duce a diffusion flame in contact with the test wall assembly. 

3. 	
Heat output. The gas burner produces a prescribed net rate of heat output of 8535 Btu/min (150 kW) for a period of 10 minutes, after which the flame exposure is terminated. 

4. 
Resistance to fire penetration. The test method mea­sures the ability of the wall system to resist fire penetra­tion from the exterior to the unexposed side of the test assembly under the conditions of exposure. Observa­tions are made for the appearance of sustained flaming or glow on the unexposed side and/or sustained glowing on the unexposed side at the end of a 60-minute obser­vation period. 


12-7 A-1.6 Equipment. Unless otherwise noted, dimensions in the following descriptions shall be followed with a tolerance of ± 0.5 inch (13 mOl). 
1. 	
Wall assembly holding fixture. The test specimen support assembly shown in Figure 1 is designed to per­mit rapid installation and removal of wall assemblies, and to prevent edge penetration offire at the margins of the wall assembly. It includes a sturdy frame assembly to hold the specimen and a simulated soffit that is noncombustible. The frame assembly permits a 4-foot by 8-foot (1220 mm by 2440 mm) prefabricated wall section to be inserted and to be sealed in such a way that protects the edges from fire. Side shields are situated near the vertical edges and to within 12 inches (304 mm) of the top of the test wall assembly as shown in Figure 1 to aid in minimizing extraneous drafts to the surface of the assembly. 

2. 	
Burner. 


2.1 	Burner details. The ignition source for the test shall be a gas diffusion burner with a nominal 4-inch-wide by 39-inch-Iong (100 mm wide by 1000 mm long) porous top surface of a refractory material, as shown in Figure 2. With the exception of top surface dimensions, the essential configura­tion of the burner is comparable to the burner design described in ASTM E 2257. The burner enclosure shall be positioned so that it is centered relative to the width of the test wall. The distance from the bottom ofthe test specimen to the top sur­face of the burner shall be 12 inches ± 2 inches (300 mm ± 50 mm). The bottom of the test speci­men shall be protected from burner fire exposure by the placement of a 4-foot-wide (1220-mm) thermal barrier consisting of nominal 0.75 inch (19 mm) cement board (or equivalent) between the burner enclosure and the test specimen. The burner enclosure shall be in contact with the protective barrier. The thermal barrier shall be positioned so that the top edge extends 3 inch ± 1 inch (76 mm ± 25 mm) above the top edge of the burner, and fas­tened to the base of the wall in such a manner to prevent obstruction of the burner flame caused by distortion away from the surface of the wall. Any gaps between the top edge of the thennal barrier and the test wall surface shaH be filled with ceramic wool, or equivalent, prior to the test. 
Natural gas, methane or propane shall be supplied 	for testing and obtain a heat release rate value

This standard can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal barriers in restricting the contribution of combustible materials in the wall and floor assemblies to fire growth in a padded safety cell. This standard shall be used in conjunction with ASTM E 603-77, "Standard Guide for Room Fire Experi­ments," which covers instrumentation, safety precautions and the general effect of various parameters. 
(b) 
Tests and listings by approved testing agency. Test data for wall andlor ceiling materials or assemblies investi­gated and tested in accordance with the Standard for Safety established by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., UL 723C, "Investigation for the Classification of Wall and Ceiling Inte­rior Finish Materials and Assemblies Using a Room Fire Test," will be acceptable for evaluation against this standard, pro­vided all instrumentation data required by this standard is incorporated in the test and report. 

(c) 
Test simulation. The test simulates a fire in the comer of an 8-foot by 12-foot compartment containing a single open doorway; this can be used to evaluate the relative performance of specific wall, ceiling and floor materials or assemblies when they are used together in the same relationship within an enclo­sure, in addition to simulating the manner in which they will be used. 

(d) 
Materials considered. The test may be used for evaluat­ing wall, ceiling and flooring finish materials and assemblies, including panels, tiles, boards, sprayed or brushed coatings, etc. 


FIRE AND SMOKE MEASUREMENTS 
AND PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD 


Sec. 12~8-102. 
(a) Significance. This fire test is applicable to a description of certain fire performance characteristics in appraising wall, ceiling and nooring materials, products, or systems under specitied fire exposure conditions in an enclosure. The test indicates the maximum extent of fire growth in an enclosure, the rate of heat release, and if they occur, the time to tlashover and the time to flame extension beyond the doorway following flashover. Time to flashover is either the time when the radiant nux onto the floor reaches 20 kW/m2 or the average tempera­ture of the upper air reaches 1 100°F. A crumpled up single sheet of newspaper may be placed on the floor 3 feet out from the center of the front wall. 
The spontaneous ignition of this newspaper will provide a visual indication of flashover. It determines both the extent to which the wall and ceiling materials or assemblies may con­tribute to fire growth in a compartment and the potential for fire spread beyond the compartment under the particular condi­tions simulated. Itdoes not measure the contribution ofthe fur­nishing materials. 
(b) Fire measurements. The potential for the spread of fire to other objects in the enclosure interior, remote from the igni­tion source, is evaluated by measurements of: 
1. 
The total heat flux incident at the center of the floor. 


2. 
A characteristic upper level gas temperature in the test compartment. 


(c) 
Fire spread potential. The potential for the spread offire to objects outside the cOmpat1ment of origin is evaluated by the measurement of the total rate of heat release of the fire. 

(d) 
Smoke measurements. Measurements ofthe rate of pro­duction of carbon monoxide and visible smoke are taken. 

(e) 
Photographic record. The overall performance of the test specimen is to be visualJy documented by full color photo­graphic records. Videotaping of the complete fire test may be done as an ahemate to the continuous photographic record. Such records may show when each area of the test specimen becomes involved in the fire. 

(f) 
Photographic Specification. Photographic equipment shall be used to continuously record the fire spread in the room and the fire projection from the door of the room. The location of the camera must avoid interference with the air inflow. 


Note: A window, cut 2-0 above the floor wall facing the gas bumer, fitted with heat-resistant, impact-resistant glazing provides useful photographic access. Flood lights should not raise the ambient temperature in the room above that specified in Section 12-8-110. The interior wall surfaces of the test room, adjacent to the corner in which the burner is located, shall be clearly marked with a 12-inch grid. A clock shall appear in all photographic records, giving the time to the nearest second (or 0.0 I minute) from the start of the test. This clock shall be accurately synchronized with all other measurements, or other provisions shall be made to corre­late the photographic record with time. Color slides shall also be taken at IS-second intervals for the first three min­utes of the test and at a minimum of 30-second intervals thereafter for the duration of the test. 
REPORT 

Sec. 12-8-103. The report shall include the following items:

6. 
The total incident heat flux at the center of the floor shall be reported for each heat flux gage as a function of time starting one minute prior to the test. 

7. 
The temperature of gases in the room, the doorway, and in the exhaust duct shall be reported for each thermo­couple as a function of time starting one minute prior to the test. The temperature recorded by the thermocouple in the duct will be used in the required calculation.

The oxygen concentration in the analyzer shall be reported as a function of time starting one minute prior to the test. 

10. 
The carbon dioxide concentration, if measured in the analyzer, shall be reported as a function of time starting one minute prior to the test. 

Note: Separate reporting of the volumetric flow rate, temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide and/or car­bon monoxide concentrations provide diagnostic information on the performance of the exhaust gas collection system and provide a check on the heat pro­duction calculations. 

11. 
The total rate 	of heat production shall be calculated from the measured oxygen and carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide concentrations, and the temperature and volumetric flow rate of the gas in the duct. 

12. 
The product of the volumetric flow rate of the gas in the duct and the carbon monoxide concentration at the specified location in the combustion hood system shall 


be reported as a function of time after the start of the test. 
13. 
The product of the volumetric flow rate of the gas in the duct at the duct gas temperature and the optical density per foot at the specified smoke meter location in the duct shall be reported as a function oftime after the start of the test. 

Note: Ifthis product is multiplied by 1.55 x 10.3, for English units, it gives the smoke units produced per second, where a smoke unit is defined as the quantity of smoke which, when distributed uniformly over a cubic meter, would have an optical density of unity over a path length of 1 meter. (This is the definition used in the Proposed ASTM Test for Heat and Visible Smoke Release Rates for Materials and Products.)

All samples shall be retained by the testing agency for a mini mum period ofthree years from the date of the test. All samples shall measure 4 inches by 4 inches by the sam­ple thickness. Two samples ofthe material in its original pretest condition shall be retained. These samples shall be taken from the same material lot used for the test samples. Post-test sam­ples from the test shall include one each, from the geometric center of each wall panel and the ceiling panel, and one each from the following locations: 
1. 	
The top, mid-height and bottom of each wall along the vertical centerline of each wall paneL 

2. 	
The quarter points ofthe ceiling, in those cases in which the test material was applied to the ceiling. 


All samples shall be clearly identified as to the material, test date and their location within the room. 
SUMMARY OF METHOD AND HEAT SOURCE 

Sec. 12-8-105. 
(a) 
Summary of method. The test involves an igmtlOn source exposure of the wall, ceiling and/or floor lining materi­als or assemblies as they would be incorporated in actual safety cell installation. 

(b) 
Heat source. This method uses a gas burner to produce a diffusion flame in contact with the walls and ceiling in the cor­ner of an 8-foot by 12-foot by 8-foot-high compartment. The burner produces a prescribed gross rate of heat output as given in Table 12-8-IA and Figure 12-8-1. 


The contribution of the wall, ceiling and flooring materials or assemblies to fire growth is measured in terms of the time history of the incident heat flux at the center of the floor, the time history of the temperature of the gases in the upper part of the compartment, the time to flashover and the rate of heat release. The test is conducted with natural ventilation to the test compartment provided through a single doorway 30 inches by 80 inches in width and height. The combustion products are collected in a hood feeding into a plenum connected to an exhaust duct in which measurements are made of the gas veloc­ity, temperature and concentrations. 
IGNlrlON SOURCE AND LOCATION 

Sec. 12-8-106. 
(a) 
Ignition source. The ignition source for the test shall be a gas burner with a nominal 12 inches by 12 inches porous top surface of a refractory material. 

Note: A burner may be constructed with a I-inch porous ceramic-fiber board over a 6-inch plenum; or alternatively a minimum 4-inch layer of Ottowa sand can be used to pro­vide the horizontal surface through which the gas is sup­plied. The sand burner may be preferable for dripping materials. This type of burner is shown in Figure 12-8-7. 

(b) 
Burner location. The top surface of the burner through which the gas is supplied shall be located horizontally, 12 inches offthe floor, and the burner enclosure shall be in contact with both walls in a corner of the room opposite from the door. The edge of the diffusion surface shall be within I inch of the wall. 

(c) 
Gas supply. The gas supply to the burner shall be pro­pane and shall produce a heat source as outlined in Section 12-8-105 (b). The flow rate shall be metered throughout the test. The burner shall be so designed that it can be set at the flow rates required to produce the gross rates ofheat release as spec­ified in Section 12-8-105 (b). 

(d) 
Ignition. The burner may be ignited by a pilot burner or a remote controlled spark igniter. 


COMPARTMENT DIMENSIONS 
AND CONSTRUCTION 


Sec. 12-S-107. 
(a) Compartment geometry and construction. The inte­rior dimensions of the floor of the fire room when the speci-
FIRE-RESISTIVE STANDARDS FOR FIRE PROTECTION 

mens are in place, shall measure 8 feet ± 1 inch x 12 feet ± 1 inch. The finished ceiling shall be 8 feet ± 0.5 inch above the floor. There shall be four walls at right angles defining the com­partment. 
Note: The experimental choices for the sizes of compart­ment fire experiments are discussed in Section 5 ofASTM E 
603. The compartment size defined in this section has been chosen to make it convenient to utilize standard sized 4-foot by 8-foot building materials or panels. 
(b) 
Doorway. There shall be a 30-inch ± 0.25-inch x 80-inch ± 0.25-inch doorway in the center ofone of the 8-foot by 8-foot walls, and no other wall or ceiling openings that will allow ven­tilation. 

(c) 
Wall construction. The wall containing the door shall be of calcium silicate board of46 pcfdensity and 0.5 inch nominal thickness. As an alternative to the calcium silicate board, 0.5-inch thick gypsum wallboard may be used. The door frame shall be constructed to remain unchanged during the test period to a tolerance of ± 1 percent in height and width. 

(d) 
Compartment construction. The test compartment may be a framed structure or a concrete block structure. If self-supporting panels are tested, a separate exterior frame or block compartment may not be required. 

(e) 
Floor materials. The floor of the test compartment shall be noncombustible as defined by ASTM E 136. 


SPECIMEN MOUNTING AND TEST MATERIAL SIZE 
Sec. 12-S-10S. 
(a) 
Specimen mounting. The specimens (e.g., the ceiling and wall materials whose condition is being tested) shall be mounted on a framing or support system comparable to that intended for their field use, using backing materials, insulation, or air gaps, as appropriate to the intended application and representing a typical value of thermal resistance for the wall system. 

(b) 
Test material size. In the test, the ceiling material shall cover the entire ceiling if such an end use application is antici­pated and the wall material shall cover three of the side walls, but not the wall containing the door. The wall and ceiling mate­rials shall be mounted in the same wall-ceiling relationship in which they are intended for use, and it therefore may be neces­sary to actually construct a section of a prototype padded safety cell. 


FIRE COMPARTMENT ENVIRONMENT 

Sec. 12-S-109. The test building in which the fire compartment is located shall have vents for the discharge of combustion products and have provisions for fresh air intake, so that no oxygen deficient air shall be introduced into the fire compart­ment during the test. Prior to initiation of the test the ambient air at the mid-height entrance to the compartment shall have a velocity in any direction of less than 100 feet per minute. The building shall be of adequate size so that there shall be no smoke accumulation in the building below the level of the top of the fire compartment. 
AMBIENT CONDITIONS IN TEST 
BUILDING AND FIRE COMPARTMENT 

Sec. 12-8-110. 
(a) 
Ambient conditions in test building. The ambient tem­perature in the test building at any location outside the fire com­partment shall be above 40°F, and the relative humidity shall be less than 75 percent for the duration of the test.

(c) 
Humidity. The ambient relative humidity in the fire com­partment for 16 hours prior to the test shall be within the range of 50 ± 5 percent. This may require the use of a humidifier or dehumidifier. 


SPECIMEN CONDITIONING 

Sec. 12-8-111. The specimens shall be conditioned prior to mounting at a temperature of 70°F ± 5°F, and at a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 percent until they reach a rate of weight change of less than 0.1 percent per day. 
INSTRUMENTATION 

Sec. 12-8-112. The following are the minimum requirements for instrumentation for this test: 
Note: Added instrumentation may be desirable for further information. 
1. 	Total heat flux gages. 
A. Location. Two gages shall be mounted within 5 inches of each other and within a distance of 2 inches above the floor surface upward in the geometric cen­ter of the floor. 
Note: See Figure 12-8-2. 
One additional gage shall be mounted in the wall adjacent to the ignition burner during calibration tests only. 
Note: See Section 12-8-113, Item 2. 
It shall be 6 feet above the floor, and 6 inches from the comer where the burner is located, along the wall opposite the doorway. The front surface of the cali­bration gage shall be flush with the wall surface, within 0.04 inch. 
B. Specification. The gages shall be ofthe Gardon type, with a flat black surface and a 180° view angle, and shall be maintained at a constant temperature, within ~ I.8°F above the dew point by water supplied at a temperature of 120°F to 150°F. This will normally require a flow rate of at least 0.1 gpm. The full-scale output range shall be 5 Btu/ft.2/sec. for the floor gage and 10 Btulft.2/sec. for the wall gage. 
Note: A suitable Gardon-type heat flux gage, man­ufactured by the Medtherm Corporation in Huntsville, Alabama, is listed under model 64-5-18 for the 5 Btu/ft?/sec. range and under model 64-10-18 for the 10 Btu/ft.2/sec. range. See 
R. Gardon, "An Instrument for the Direct Mea­surement of Intense Thermal Radiation," Review of Scientific Instruments, Vol. 24, No.5, May 1953, pp. 36-70, for further information. 
2. 	Gas temperature thermocouples. 
A. Specification. Twenty-mil-diameter bare chromel­alumel thermocouple wire within 0.5 inch of the bead should be run along expected isotherms to min­imize conduction errors. The insulation between the chromel and alumel wires must be stable to at least 2000°F or the wires must be separated. 
Note: Metal clad ceramic powder will work satis­factorily. The commonly used silicone-impreg­nated glass insulation will break down above 1500°F. 
B. Location for doorway. A thermocouple shall be located in the interior plane of the door opening on the door centerline, 1 inch down from the top. 
Note: See Figure 12-8-3. 
C. Locations for room. Thermocouples shall be located 4 inches down from the center of the ceiling and from the center ofeach of the four ceiling quad­rants, and one shall be directly over the center of the ignition burner, 4 inches below the ceiling. The thermocouples shall be mounted on supports, with their junctions at least 4 inches away from a solid surface. There shall be no attachments to the test specimens. 
Note: See Figure 12-8-3. 
D. Location in canopy hood and duct systems. One pair of thermocouples shall be placed 11 feet down­stream to the entrance to the horizontal duct. The pair of thermocouples shall straddle the center ofthe duct and be separated by 2 inches from each other. 
Note: See Figure 12-8-4. 
3. 	Canopy hood and exhaust duct location and design. A hood shall be installed immediately adjacent to the door of the fire room. The bottom of the hood shall be level with the top surface of the room. The face dimen­sions of the hood shall be minimum 8 feet by 8 feet and the depth shall be 3.5 feet. The hood shall feed into a plenum having a 3-foot by 3-foot cross section. 
Note: See Figure 12-8-4. 
The plenum shall have a minimum height of 3 feet. The height can be increased up to a maximum of 6 feet to satisfy building constraints. The exhaust duct con­nected to the plenum shall be 16 inches in diameter, hor­izontal, and shall have a circular aperture of 12 inches at its entrance. 
The hood shall have sufficient draft to collect all the combustion products leaving the room. This draft should be capable ofmoving up to 5,000 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) during the test. Provisions shall be made to vary the draft so that it can operate at either 1,000 or 5,000 scfm. Mixing vanes may also be required in the duct ifconcentration gradients are found to exist. 
An alternate exhaust system design may be used if it has been shown to produce equivalent results. Equiva­lency may be shown by meeting the requirements of Section 12-8-113, Item 5. 
4. 	Duct gas velocity specification. A bidirectional probe or equivalent measuring system shall be used to mea­sure gas velocity in the duct. 
Note: See B. J. McCaffrey and G. Heskjestad, Com­bustion and Flame, 26, 125-127 (1976). 
The probe shown in Figure 12-8-6 consists of a short stainless steel cylinder 1.75-inch long and 0.975-inch inside diameter with a solid diaphragm in the center. The pressure taps on either side of the diaphragm sup­port the probe. The axis of the probe shall be along the centerline of the duct 11 feet downstream from the entrance. The taps shall be connected to a pressure transducer which shall be able to resolve pressure dif­ferences of 0.000 I-inch of water. 
Notes: 
1. 	
Capacitance-type transducers have been found to be the most stable for this application. 

2. 	
The bidirectional probe is specified rather than the pilot -static tube in order to avoid problems of clog­ging with soot. 


5. 	
Duct oxygen concentration specification. A stainless steel gas sampling tube shall be located 13 feet down­stream from the entrance to the duct, to obtain a contin­uously flowing sample for determining the oxygen concentration ofthe exhaust gas as a function oftime. A suitable filter and cold trap shall be placed in the line to remove particulates and water. The oxygen analyzer shall be of the paramagnetic or polarographic type and shall be capable of measuring the reduction in oxygen concentration over the range of0.21 down to 0.15 with an accuracy of ± 2 percent in this concentration range. The signal from the oxygen analyzer must be within 5 percent ofits final value in 30 seconds after introducing a step change in composition of the gas stream flowing past the inlet to the sampling tube. 

6. 	
Duct carbon dioxide concentration specification. The gas sampling tube defined in Section 12-8-112, Item 5, or an alternate tube in the same location, shall provide a continuous sample for the measurement of the carbon dioxide concentration with an analyzer which has a range of 0 to 20 percent and a maximum error of 2 percent of full-scale. The total system response time between the sampling inlet and the meter shall be no greater than 30 seconds. 


FIRE-RESISTIVE STANDARDS FOR FIRE PROTECTION 

7. 	
Duct carbon monoxide concentration specification. The gas sampling tube defined in Section 12-8-112, Item 5, or an alternate tube in the same location, shall provide a continuous sample for the measurement of the carbon monoxide concentration with an analyzer which has a range of 0 to 10 percent and a maximum error of 2 percent of full-scale. 

8. 	
Optical density of smoke in duct specification (sup­plementary measurement), A meter shall be installed to measure the optical density of the exhaust gases in a vertical path across the width ofa horizontal duct, 1 foot downstream of the duct velocity probe. A horizontal path should be used with a vertical duct. 


A suitable design for the meter is as follows: Use as a light source a number 1810 lamp which is rated at 6.3 volts, 0040 amps, and 1.5 candela and is operated at 5 volts d.c. The lamp is mounted at the focal point of a +20 diopter and 50 mm diameter double con­vex collimating lens. At the other side of the duct the collimated beam is intercepted by a + 10 diopter 50 mm diameter plane convex lens and concentrated onto the cathode of a IP39 phototube. A Coming CS3-132 type 3304 filter (available from the Swift Glass Company, Box 890, Elmira Heights, NY 14903) is used in front of the phototube to correct its spectral response to the stan­dard photoptic curve of the human eye. The lens, filter and phototube are mounted inside of a light-tight housing which is blackened inside to mini­mize internal reflections. The phototube is connected to a linear operational power amplifier with an adjustable gain of 106 which in tum is connected to a commercially available log ratio amplifier to produce an output volt­age proportional to the optical density. A smoke meter meeting the above requirements is described in a report by R. W. Bukowski, "Smoke Measurements in Large­and Small-scale Fire Testing," NBSIR 78-1502, Octo­ber 1978. Alternate systems can be used, but the color temperature of the light source must match that of the 1810 lamp under the specified operating conditions, and the light receiver, including the photo detector, must match the standard photoptic curve of the eye. The optical density shall be continuously recorded over the duration of the test. After completion of the test, the optical density reading must be less than 0.02 (transmission higher than 95 percent). 
CALIBRATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF 
IGNITION SOURCE AND TEST EQUIPMENT 

Sec. 12-8-113. A calibration test shall be performed prior to and within 30 days of any fire test. The calibration test, to last for15 minutes, shall use the standard ignition source with inert wall and ceiling materials (calcium silicate board of46 pef den­sity and 0.5-inch thickness. The following quantities shall be reported: 
1. 	Once the burner is activated, the output of all instru­ments normally used in the test is to be measured and data recorded as a function of time. 
2. 	
The time history of the total heat flux at the wallloca­tion. 

3. 
The maximum extension 	of the burner flame as recorded by still color photographs of 0.1 second expo­sure time taken at a minimum of 30-second intervals, or more often ifit is changing rapidly. These shall be taken with a camera operating in the "operative mode" with the camera set to the standard ASA ratings ofthe film. 

4. 	
The temperature and velocity profiles across the duct cross-section at the location ofthe bidirectional probe if one is used. These profiles shall be used to determine the factor "k" in Equation 12, Appendix 12-8-IA. 

5. 	
The total rate of heat production is determined both by the oxygen consumption calculation and by the metered gas input. These must agree within 5 percent. 


Note: The net heat of combustion is 2,283 Btu/ft3 for propane at 68°F and 14.7 psi. This value should be used in this calculation. 
TEST PROCEDURE 

Sec. 12-8-114. The following paragraphs describe the steps in the test procedure: 
1. 	
Establish an initial volumetric flow rate of 1,000 cfm through the duct if a forced ventilation system is used. If a forced ventilation system is used, increase the volume flow rate through the duct to 5,000 cfm when the oxy­gen content falls below 18 percent. 

2. 	
Tum on all sampling and recording devices and estab­lish steady state baseline readings for at least one minute. 

3. 
Ignite the gas burner and start the clock simultaneously. Increase gas flow rate in steps as indicated in Section 12-8-106 (c). 

4. 
Take 35 mm color slides at IS-second intervals during the first three minutes and at 30-second intervals there­after to photographically document the growth of the fire. 

5. 	
Provide a continuous voice or written record ofthe fire, which will give times of all significant events such as 


flame attachment to the wall, flames out ofthe doorway, flashover, etc. 
6. 	
The ignition burner shall be shut off at 15 minutes after initiation of the test and the test terminated at that time unless safety considerations dictate an earlier termina­tion. 

7. 	
Photograph and verbally describe the damage after the test. 


FLASHOVER AND SMOKE 

Sec. 12-8-115. 
(a) Flashover. The criterion for acceptable performance shall be that the compartment never reaches flashover at any time during the 15-minute period of ignition source burner operation. Flashover shall be considered to have occurred if one or more ofthe following conditions occur during the test: 
1. 	
The average ceiling gas temperature, as determined by averaging the temperature at the center and quarter point thermocouples, reaches or exceeds III2°F. 

2. 	
The total heat flux at the floor, as determined by either of the total heat flux meters mounted in the geometric center of the floor, reaches or exceeds a value of 1.761 BtU/ft.2/sec. 

3. 	
Visible flaming extends from the doorway of the test compartment. 


(b) Smoke. Materials meeting the acceptance criteria of this standard shall have a smoke density rating no greater than 75 when tested in the thickness intended for use by UBC Standard 26-5, or when tested in accordance with UBC Standard 8-1. 
MARKINGS 

Sec. 12-8-116. All materials shall be provided with a manufac­turer's label or other permanent marking clead y identifying the manufacturer label or other permanent marking clearly identi­fying the manufacturer, the product and model numbers (or brand name). Materials approved and listed by the State Fire Marshal shall be marked as required by Section 1.58, Title 19,

DE TO 

GENERAL 

Sec. 12-8-1B.l. 
(a) 
Basic. This guide is intended as an aid in determining the method of mounting various building materials in the standard fire test room. These mountings are described for test method uniformity and good laboratory practice; they are not meant to imply restriction in the specific details of field installation. They are intended to be used for general material testing where the specific details of the field installation either have not been established or are so broad that any single installation method may not be representative of the full range of installation possi­bilities. 

(b) 
Mounting methods. The suggested mounting methods are grouped according to building materials to be tested which are broadly described either by usage or by form of the mate­rial. For some building materials, none of the methods described may be applicable. In such cases, other means of attachment may have to be devised. Wherever possible, these specimens shall be mounted using the same method of attach­ment as that contemplated in the field installation. 

(c) 
All backing materials, when used, shall be supported on a framed support system. A typical supporting framework is shown in Figure 12-8-1B-l. 

(d) 
Whenever calcium silicate board or gypsum wallboard is specified as a backing substrate in subsequent paragraphs, the material shall be O.S-inch-thick calcium silicate board sup~lied in 4 feet by 8 feet sheets with a density of 46 lb/ft , or 0.62S-inch-thick gypsum wallboard "Type X" supplied in 4 feet by 8 feet sheets with a density of 42.2Ib/fe, and they shall be uncoated. Where metal screws in combination with washers and wing nuts are specified for fastening, they shall be standard 0.2S-inch by 20 TPI round head steel machine screws, 0.2S-inch by 20 TPI steel wing nuts and 2 inch O.D. by 0.044-inch-thick Hat steel washers with a 0.281-inch I.D. hole. Fastening screws shall be installed as shown in Figure l2-8-1B-2. The fastening pattern is shown in Figure 12-8-1B-3 for rigid wall matetials and Figure 12-8-1 B-4 for flexible wall materials. The fastening pattern for all ceiling materials is shown in Figure 12-8-IB-S. 


ACOUSTiCAL MATERIALS 
AND OTHER BOARD MATERIALS 


Sec. 12-8-1E.2. 
(a) 
Depending on the type of field mounting required by the acoustical product, either wood furring strips or metal runners are to be used to support acoustical material. 

(b) 
Wood furring strips for mounting acoustical materials and other board materials are to be nominal I-inch by 2-inch wood furring strips and attached to a gypsum wall board sub­strate to approximately the field installation. 


NG 

(c) Metal runners for mounting are to be attached to the 0.62S-inch gypsum wallboard substrate to approximate the field suspension systems application. 
BATT OR BLANKET-TYPE INSULATING 
AND OTHER FLEXIBLE MATERIALS 


Sec. 12-8-1B.3. Batt or blanket and other flexible materials which do not have sufficient rigidity or strength to support themselves are to be supported by round head machine screws in combination with wing nuts and flat washers, as specified in Section 12-8-1B.l (d), which are inserted through the material in such a way as to fasten the material to a substrate board. 
BUILDING UNITS 

Sec. 12-8-1B.4. Materials falling within this category include organic and/or inorganic materials formed or laminated into blocks, boards, planks, slabs or sheets of various sizes, thick­nesses or shapes. If building units have sufficient structural integrity to support themselves, no additional mounting to a substrate board support is required. Ifthe building units are of such construction as to require individual components and are not self-supporting, the component is to be fastened to the sub­strate board as specified in Section 12-8-1B.1 (d). 
COATINGS OR SPRAY APPLIED MATERIALS 
Sec. 12-8-tB.S. 
(a) 
Coating materials, such as cementitious mixtures, mastic coatings, sprayed fibers, etc., are to be mixed and applied to the substrate board as specified in the manufacturer's instructions at the thickness, coverage rate or density recommended by the manufacturer. 

(b) 
Materials intended for application to a wood surface are to be applied to a substrate made of 1 inch by 4 inches nominal "C" and better VG Douglas fir flooring (FSC 70 to 90) or to other species for which the surface burning characteristic is to be measured. 

(c) 
Coating materials intended for application to particular combustible surfaces, but not wood, are to be applied to the specific surface for which they are intended. The coating mate­rial and combustible material are to be attached to the substrate board as specified in Section 12-8-] B.1 (d). 

(d) 
Coating materials intended only for field applications to nonHammable surfaces are to be applied to O.S in calcium sili­cate board. 


WALL COVERING MATERIAL 

Sec. 12-8-1B.6. Wall coverings such as vinyl coatings, wallpa­per, etc., of various types are to be mounted on O.625-inch gyp­sum wallboard or on the actual substrate to which they are to be applied, using the adhesive and application technique specified by the manufacturer.

QUALITY STANDARDS 

Sec. 12-13-1553. The manufacturer shall cause the testing of samples of insulating material for conformity with the quality standards described in this section. 
(a) General testing provisions. In testing any material pur­suant to this section, the following general procedures shall be used. 
1. 	
All tests with the exception of the ANSIIASTM E 84-79 test shall be conducted using representative samples at the representative thickness of the insulation, except that when the final use of an insulating material entails a thickness less than the representative thickness, then the insulating material will be tested at the lesser thick­ness. 

2. 	
Where uniformity of product ensures consistency of test results across a product grouping, test results for one may be used for certification of other products within that product group. The manufacturer shall pro­vide sufficient documentation to establish a valid basis for applying a particular test result to other products within the group. 

The Executive Director shall determine whether a valid basis exists for grouping products for testing pur­suant to this subsection. If it is determined that a valid basis does not exist, individual tests shall be required. A manufacturer may appeal the Executive Director's determination to the full Commission. 

3. 	
Thermal performance of building insulations shall be stated in R value. Other insulations shall use thermal conductivity, conductance, or R value as appropriate. 

4. 	
All thermal performance tests shall be conducted on materials which have been conditioned at 73.4 ° ± 3.6°F and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 percent for 24 hours immediately preceding the tests. The average testing temperature shall be 75° ± 2°F with at least a 40°F tem­perature difference. 


5. 	
Aluminum foil insulation shall be tested according to ANSI/ASTM C 236-66 to determine the thermal per­formance in horizontal, upward and downward direc­tions. The tested thermal performance in the heat-flow direction or directions of the intended application shall be labeled on the material. The man­ufacturer shall test once in each direction of intended application, except that for products labeled with only one heat-flow direction, the manufacturer shall test two samples in that direction. 

6. 	
Insulation (other than aluminum foil insulation mate­rials) for which additional value is claimed for facings and air spaces shall be tested for thermal perfonnance as a material without the air space pursuant to this arti­cle. The manufacturer may elect to report additional thermal performance values of a given construction tested according to ANSIIASTM C 236-66 for that construction as long as full details ofthat construction are also disclosed in the certification statement and pursuant to Section 1557 (c) ofthis article. Ifa manu­facturer elects to report a thermal performance value for a material plus an air space (as supplemental infor­mati on to the required material thermal perfor­mance), but not necessarily for a full construction, the manufacturer must also disclose the conditions of the test and the limitations to the attainment ofthat result. 

7. 
Except as provided in Items 5 and 6, the thermal per­formance test results certified under Section 1555 of this article shall be the average of the values obtained from at least three tests. 

8. 	
The average measured thermal performance of the tests required by Items 5, 6 and 7 shall not be more than 5 percent below the value specified on the prod­uct. In addition, all insulation material sold within the state after September 22, 1981, shall have a measured thermal performance not more than 10 percent below the value specified on the product. 

9. 	
All numbered test descriptions shall be contained in the document "Test Descriptions for Insulating Mate­rial" dated February 27, 1981. 

10. 
Facings on representative samples may be removed or modified by slitting for the ANSI/ASTM C 177-76 and ANSI/ASTM C 518-76 tests. 

11. 
All thermal performance testing equipment used for testing insulating materials shall be calibrated with samples referenced to the United States National Bureau of Standards. 

12. 
Manufacturers of loose fill insulations for which no settled density test is required by this section shall be required to include the installed design density in the identifying information described in Section 1557. The manufacturer shall provide sufficient documen­tation to establish a valid basis for the determination of installed design density. 


The Executive Director shall determine whether a valid basis exists for the installed design density claimed by the manufacturer. Ifit is determined that a valid basis does not exist, the director may assign an appropriate installed design density or may require an appropriate test to determine the installed design den­sity. The manufacturer may appeal the Executive Director's determination to the full Commission. 
l3. Within 180 days after the availability of appropriate representative thickness calibration samples from the National Bureau of Standards, all insulating materials thicker than 1 inch, which have not previously been tested at the representative thickness of a representa­tive sample, shall be tested at representative thickness and recertified. Test results and a revised certification statement will be submitted to the Executive Director. The Executive Director shall determine if and when an appropriate representative thickness calibration sample is available from the National Bureau of Stan­dards and shall publish a list of available representa­tive thickness calibration samples. The manufacturer may appeal the Executive Director's determination to the full Commission.

AIR FILTERS STANDARD 12-71-1 
STATE FIRE MARSHAL 


DESCRIPTION OF TEST APPARA1"US, METHOD 
AND CLASSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
FOR AIR FILTERS 

Sec. 12-71-100.  
(a) Test apparatus.  
1. The test duct, made ofM.S.  galvanized sheet metal  
reinforced with angle irons, 13 1 / 2 feet long.  21 inches square and  

2. 
One end of the duct is tapered to the discharge of a vali­able-speed blower and the other end is open to dis­charge. A metal filter frame is provided near the middle of the length of the duct to receive one 20 by 20 inches (nominal) filter unit. Two tightfitting doors, located to permit access to the filter frame, are each provided with a mica window to permit observation of both faces of the filter and conditions in the duct downstream from the filter. 

3. 	
Two I-inch pipe elbows, about 18 inches from the base ofthe test filter, form gas burner outlets adjusted to pro­vide yellow, wavering flames. The burners consume approximately 4 cubic feet (approximately 1,000 Btu/cubic feet) of gas per minute. 

4. 
With the filter 	in place the air velocity is adjusted to approximately 200 linear feet per minute as measured at the discharge end of the duct by an Alnor Velometer Anemometer. 



(b) Test method. 
1. 	
Filters are tested clean, that is, unused. The names are applied for three minutes during which time observa­tions are made ofboth faces of the filter as to the down­stream travel of flame or sparks and the density, duration and character of the products of combustion. 

2. 	
Smoke density is measured as the drop in light intensity on a microammeter by means of photoelectric cell mounted a few inches below and about 12 inches inside the discharge end of the duct. The light source, stabi­lized for light intensity, is mounted 1 inch above the duct directly above the photoelectric cell. The microammeter readings are recorded every five sec­onds for the first minute and every 10 seconds for the next two minutes. 

3. 	
The differences between these readings and the readings 


taken before the test are plotted against time (the scale being 40 ~Aand 40 seconds to the inch) with the result­ing area under the curve being measured by use of a planimeter or calculated mathematically. This area is a measure of the smoke density produced during the test. 

(c) Classification. As a result of the tests, air filter units are classified as Class 1 or 2 as indicated below: 
1. 	
Class 1 air filter units are those which, when clean, do not produce flames or sparks when attacked by flame and which develop areas under the smoke density curves that are less than 1.5 square inches. 

2. 	
Class 2 air filter units are those which, when clean, bum moderately when attacked by flame or emit moderate amounts of smoke or both. These units, although they may be consumed to some extent, do not project flames or extensive sparks that would ignite adjacent combus­tible materials beyond the discharge end of the duct dur­ing the test and do not develop areas under the smoke density curves that are more than 6.0 square inches. 



(d) Adhesive coatings. Liquid-adhesive coatings used on filters shaH have a flash point of 325°F Cleveland open cup tester, or higher.

(p) Abnormal operation. 
1. 	
A control unit shall be capable of operating under abnormal conditions without emission of name, molten metal or other manifestation of a fire hazard. Excessive temperatures or burnout is indicative of failure. 

2. 	
A control unit connected to a supply circuit of rated voltage shall have its alarm initiating and audible alarm circuits short-circuited until a constant temperature is attained, or burnout occurs, unless the fault results in operation of an overcurrent device which is an integral component part of the unit. 


(q) Burnout tests.

3. 
The testing circuit shall be protected by overcurrent devices having a rating of at least ten times the primary current rating of the transformer. Output terminals of the transformer shall be short-circuited, if such a condi­tion results in less than three times the maximum nor­mal load current being drawn from the secondary. Tests shall be continued until constant temperatures are attained or a burnout occurs. Blowing of the fuse on the primary side of the transformer is not considered to be a failure. 

4. 	
If the circuit designs of a control unit or combination signaling system incorporate a time limit cutout or a mercury tube switch wired into the system circuit in such a manner that a short circuit or a ground fault causes the device to carry current in excess of its maxi­mum normal load, it shall withstand the test specified in Items 5 through 7, without introducing a fire hazard.

The source of current and the test cir­cuit should have sufficient capacity to deliver 1,000 amperes when the system is short-circuited at the test­ing terminals. 


7. 	Ignition of the cotton, or of insulation on circuit con­ductors, emission of flame or molten metal from the enclosure, blowing ofthe fuse in the grounding conduc­tor, damage to other parts of the control equipment, or any evidence of a fire hazard is to be deemed as failure. Burnout of pigtail leads or a thermal element, or weld­ing of contacts, is not to be considered as a failure. 
PRINTED WIRING BOARDS 

Sec. 12·72-104. 
(a) General. 
1. 	
These requirements cover printed wiring boards that are intended for use in fire protective signaling equip­ment. The acceptability of the combination of the printed wiring board and the electric equipment is to be determined by the State Fire Marshal. 

2. 	
Printed wiring boards conforming to ASTM Grade FR-5 when tested in accordance with ASTM Designa­tion D-1867, may be used in protective signaling equipment. 

3. 	
Throughout these requirements, the term "printed wir­ing" is used to designate a pattern of conductive mate­rial formed in a predetermined design on the surface or surfaces of a common insulating base, and intended pri­marily to provide point to point electrical connections, shielding or to form inductors. The term "printed wir­ing board" is used to designate the combination of a printed writing pattern and the common insulating base completely processed as far as the printed portion is concerned. The term "printed wiring assembly" is used to designate a printed wiring board on which separate components have been added. 

4. 
Printed wiring boards which do not conform to Item 3, shall be tested in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 12-72-104 (b) through (d). 



(b) 
Insulating material. Insulating material on which printed wiring is applied shall be suitable for the sole support of uninsulated live parts and for the temperature involved, and shall have suitable mechanical strength. 

(c) 
Conductors. 


1. 	
Current-carrying parts ofprinted wiring shall be ofcop­per, copper-alloy, aluminum, silver or other material having similar corrosion-resisting properties. 

2. 	
Conductor surfaces shall be substantially free of wrin­kles, pits, blisters, corrosion or other imperfections before and after being subjected to the conditions described in Item 6. 

3. 	
Printed wiring shall be so applied to the insulating material that the average strength of the bond between the printed wiring and the insulating base for each indi­vidual strip of conductor will not be less than 1 pound per inch of width of the printed wiring when samples are tested under the conditions described in Items 4 through 7. 

4. 	
The samples of printed wiring boards are to be without components (capacitors, resistors, etc.) and, except at points where connections are to be made, the conduc-


PROTECTIVE SIGNALING SYSTEMS 
tors are to be free from solder. Ifthe normal production soldering operation results in a coating of solder on the conductors, the samples are to be subjected to a simu­lated soldering operation, using a material other than solder, at the normal soldering temperature, or an equivalent arrangement, in order to obtain the same thermal effect on the conductors. 
5. 
A uniform width of the printed wiring is to be peeled from the insulating material for a distance of 1/4 inch at a uniform rate of approximately 12 inches per minute, with the angle between the printed conductor and the insulating material at not less than 85 degrees, and the force required to separate the conductor from the insu­lating material measured. Three determinations are to be made on each of six samples, and the average strength ofthe bond for each individual strip or conduc­tor determined. 

6. 
Following the test described in the preceding para­graph, three of the samples are to be placed in an air oven maintained at the temperature determined by the following expression for 1,344 consecutive hours: 



T 1.02 (R + 15 + 273) 273, where 
T = oven temperature in °C. 
R = temperature in °C for which the printed material is to be recognized (75°, 90°, 105° or 125°C). 
The remaining three samples are to be placed first in the air oven for 168 hours and then in a moist air chamber having a relative humidity of 83.5-86.5 percent at a temperature of 30.5°-33.5°C, for 168 hours, and the cycle repeated for a total of 1,344 hours (four 168-hour periods in the air oven alternating with four 168-hour periods in the moist air). 
7. 
After 1,344 hours under the conditions described in the preceding paragraph, the six samples are to be allowed to cool to room temperature and then subjected to the test described in Item 5 and the average strength of the bond determined for each sample. 

8. 	
The use of coatings over printed wiring will be given special consideration with respect to their effect on the strength of the bond between the printed wiring and the insulating materiaL 



(d) Dielectric strength. 
1. 	
The average dielectric breakdown potential for six sam­ples of printed wiring boards that have been condi­tioned in an air oven for 1,344 hours at the temperature determined by the formula in Section 12-72-104 (c), Item 6, shall be not less than 80 percent of the average dielectric breakdown potential for six samples of printed wiring boards that have not been subjected to such conditioning. 

2. 
The 12 samples may be provided without components (capacitors, sockets, resistors, etc.) but are to be sam­ples that have been subjected to the complete produc­tion soldering process. The test potential is to be obtained from a suitable transformer, the output voltage of which can be regulated. The potential is to be increased gradually from zero, at the rate, of approxi­mate 75 volts per second, until dielectric breakdown 



occurs. Three different locations on each sample, with different spacings between conductors, if possible, are to be tested. The locations selected are to be the same for all samples. The average dielectric breakdown potentials for each group of six samples for each loca­tion is to be determined. The average value for each location for the samples that have been conditioned is to be not less than 80 percent of the average value for the corresponding location for the samples that have not been conditioned. 
RELAYS FOR PROTECTIVE SIGNALING SERVICE 
Sec. 12-72-105.

2. 
A calibration means considered to be not accessible or apparent is one not exposed to manipulation by tools, or one not readily replaceable. The complete concealment of tool-engagement means in a screw, such as a slot, recessed head, etc., by the use of solder or brazing mate­rial is considered adequate for the purpose of prevent­ing manipulation or replacement. 


(d) Materials. 
1. 	
A part shall be constructed of materials that are accept­able for the intended application and shall be of ade­quate mechanical strength. 

2. 	
Diaphragms and spring parts shall be made of nonfer­rous material, such as phosphor bronze, nickel, silver, etc., or of ferrous materials. If ferrous materials are employed, they shall be hermetically sealed or plated so as not to be affected adversely by corrosion. 

3. 	
A eutectic element, ifused as the operating member ofa fire alarm device, shall be constructed so as not to be affected adversely by conditions to which it is likely to be exposed in service, as represented by the tests described in Section 12-72-203. 

4. 	
All exposed parts likely to be affected adversely by cor­rosion shall be protected by enameling, galvanizing, sherardizing, plating or equivalent means. 


(e) Operating mechanisms. 
1. 	
The moving parts of a fire alann device shall have suffi­cient play at bearing surfaces to prevent binding. 

2. 	
The manually operated parts of a fire alarm device shall have sufficient strength to withstand the stresses to which they will be subjected in service. 

3. 	
A gear train driving spring shall be reliably anchored at each end. The spring winding means shall be provided with a positive stop to limit the winding or shall with­stand the maximum force likely to be applied without affecting the operation of the mechanism adversely.

PERFORMANCE Sec. 12-72-203. 
(a) General. 
1. 	
Representative samples of units in commercial form shall be subjected to the following applicable tests. 

2. 	
If a device(s) is required to be mounted in a definite position in order to function properly, it shall be tested in that position. 

3. 	
If a device is normally intended to be connected to tub­ing to function, it shall be connected to the maximum length of tubing specified by the manufacturer unless the length of tubing would not have a bearing on its operation. 


(b) Determination of spacings. 
1. 	
The sensitivity of a fire alarm device is to be expressed in terms of spacing limitations. Spacing limitations refer to the maximum distance permitted between devices mounted on smooth ceilings. 

2. 	
Installation spacing limitations of a fire alann device are developed by an oven test (15-foot spacing only) or by a fire test. See Sections 12-72-203 (c) and (d). 

3. 	
Determination of spacings is obtained by the testing of ordinary degree ratings. Devices shall be sufficiently sensitive to qualify for at least a IS-foot spacing limitation. 

4. 
An ordinary-degree rating, with a spacing of 15 feet, may be tested for sensitivity by being subjected to the oven test. See Section 12-72-203 (c), Item 1. If the device does not operate within two minutes, a fire test shall be conducted. 

5. 
A fire alarm device is not acceptable if it fails to qualify for at least a IS-foot spacing, i.e., does not operate within two minutes in the oven test, and does not oper­ate when subjected to the fire test. 


(c) Oven test. 
1. 	
A fire alarm device shall operate in a normal and uni­form manner when tested to the time-temperature curve illustrated in Figure 12-72-2-1. A sample shall be uni­form in operation when mounted in the same position inside the oven. Operation is considered uniform if the device operates within a tolerance of 15°F (8.3°C) for an ordinary rated unit and 20°F (11°C) for an interme­diate rated unit. A fire alarm device which operates within two minutes or less is suitable for a IS-foot spac­ing allocation. 


2. 	
The test apparatus consists of a full draft circulating air oven capable of producing the time-temperature curve illustrated in Figure 12-72-2-1. Air is to be moved past the sample at a velocity of 230 to 245 feet per minute. The temperature in the oven is recorded by means of a thermocouple and calibrated potentiometer. 

3. 	
The device under test is to be installed in the test oven with its temperature-sensitive element located in the air streams and positioned so that there is no obstruction of the moving air to the sensing element. 

4. 
After installation in the oven, the device is to be sub­jected to the time-temperature conditions illustrated by Figure 12-72-2-1. The time of actuation is to be recorded at the instant the unit goes into alarm. 

5. 	
To determine that the performance ofa fire alarm device is uniform, five samples are to be tested, using a differ­ent sample for each test, but each of the five samples is to be installed inside the chamber in the same position. 


(d) Fire test. 
1. 	
A fire alarm device, installed at the intended spacing, shall operate prior to the 160°F (71.1 °C) rated sprin­klers installed on a 10-foot spacing schedule when both are simultaneously exposed to a control fire condition. 

2. 	
The test room is to be equipped with automatic sprin­kler piping arranged to receive automatic sprinklers on a 10-by-l0-foot spacing schedule. Sprinklers of the standard upright spray type are to be installed with the deflectors approximately 7 inches below the ceil­ing, which is normal for sprinkler piping installation. For each test, new automatic sprinklers of the same make and ratings are to be installed in the sprinkler piping. The devices under test are to be installed at their designated spacing, minimum 15 feet, in line with the sprinkler and fire test plan. See Figure 12-72-2-2 for layout. 

3. 	
This test is to be conducted in a room having a smooth ceiling with no physical obstructions between the fire source and devices under test and with minimum air movement. The room is to be provided for maintain­ing the room temperature ambient, if necessary. The heaters are to be shut off during a test trial. 

4. 
The room shall be of sufficient cross-sectional area so that the devices under test are located in accordance with the spacing layout illustrated by Figure 12-72-2-2. The reflection of heated air is to be pre­vented from returning to the devices under test from 


PROTECTIVE SIGNALING SYSTEMS 
adjacent wall surfaces during the course of the fire test. The room height shall be such that the vertical distance from the base of the fire to the ceiling is approximately 12 feet. 
5. 
Fire tests are to be produced by burning denatured alcohol consisting of 190 proof ethanol to which 5 percent methanol has been added as a denaturant, in steel pans ofa size necessary to produce a temperature rise sufficient to operate the automatic sprinklers in two minutes, ± 10 seconds, when installed on a 10-by-l0-foot spacing schedule. Since temperature conditions in the test room may vary throughout the year, it is necessary to utilize different pan sizes in order to obtain the proper temperature-rise condition. This test condition develops a time-temperature curve similar to that shown in Figure 12-72-2-1. 

6. 	
The fire tests are to be conducted to compare the oper­ating time of the fire alarm devices when installed at their recommended spacing schedule as compared with the operating time of automatic sprinklers installed on the standard 10-by-l0-foot spacing schedule. Operation of the devices prior to the sprin­kler will qualify the device for a spacing on which it is installed. Since automatic sprinklers vary in their sen­sitivity, the particular sprinkler utilized in these tests is to be one which has average operating response under uniform temperature-rise conditions. 

7. 
Four units shall be subjected simultaneously to the fire test condition and all four units are required to respond prior to the sprinkler. 

8. 	
For units which may be mounted on a side wall, the device under test shall be mounted in a vertical posi­tion so that the distance between the top of the unit and the ceiling is 6 inches. The front of the units shall face the fire source and any surfaces on which the units are mounted shall be of a configuration to pre­vent reflection of heat onto the detector element. 

9. 	
Ifa fire alarm device is intended to be mounted on the ceiling, the unit shall be so installed for this test. 

10. 
If a device is intended to be employed with an enclo­sure, such as used in mounting, it shall be subjected to the fire test using the enclosure representative of nor­mal installation. 



(e) High-temperature exposure test. 
1. 	
A fire alarm device shall not operate when subjected for 30 days to the test ambient temperature indicated in Table 12-72-2A. Following the exposure the response of the units shall not show a variation of more than 10 percent from the value obtained in the Oven Test on as-received samples. There shall be no change in the sound intensity when tested following the exposure. There shall be no evidence ofeutectic flow as a result of this test. 

2. 	
Devices capable of repeated operation are to be sub­jected to the Oven Test before and after exposure to the test temperature ambient. Where devices are not capa­ble of repeated operation the response data after expo­sure is to be compared to the response of identical as-received samples. 


3. 	
A fire alarm device shall withstand the high-tempera­ture exposure without false operation and there shall be no visible deformation or change in the temperature sensitive element or any other part of the unit as a result of the test. 

4. 
Five samples ofeach temperature rating are to be tested for their normal operating temperature after which they are to be placed in a circulating air oven maintained at the test temperature. 

5. 	
The units are to be removed from the oven after the 30­day period, allowed to remain at room temperature for at least 24 hours and then subjected to the oven test. 


(f) Corrosion tests. 
1. 	
The response of a fire alarm device, after being sub­jected to corrosive atmospheres, shall not show a varia­tion of more than 50 percent from the value obtained in the oven test on as-received samples. No false alarms shall occur during the exposure and there shall be no change in the sound intensity when the units are sub­jected to the oven test. 

2. 	
Devices capable of repeated operations are to be sub­jected to the oven test before and after exposure to the corrosive atmospheres. Where devices are not capable of repeated operation, the response data obtained from the oven test is to be compared to the response ofidenti­cal as-received samples. 

3. 	
Two samples are to be exposed for 10 days to an atmo­sphere containing approximately 1 percent hydrogen sulfide by volume in air saturated with water vapor at room temperature. 

4. 	
Two samples are to be exposed for 10 days to an atmo­sphere containing approximately 1 percent sulphur dioxide in 1 percent carbon dioxide by volume in air saturated with water vapor at room temperature. 

5. 
After exposure to the corrosive atmospheres, the sam­ples are to be removed from the test chamber, allowed to remain in a normal atmosphere at room temperature for at least 24 hours and then subjected to the oven test. 

6. 
This test is to be conducted only on devices of the ordi­nary degree rating unless there is reason to anticipate different behavior of other ratings. 


(g) Operating temperature test. 
1. 	
A fire alarm device shall operate in a normal manner and within the operating temperature limits and toler­ances included in Table 12-72-2B, when subjected to an operating temperature test in heated water, oil or air bath. 

2. 	
Five samples of each temperature rating are to be sub­jected to this test. Depending on their particular design, the devices are to be suspended in a circulating water, oil or air bath, and the temperature gradually increased at the rate of 1°F (0.6°C) per minute until operation takes place. The temperature ofthe bath at the instant of operation is to be recorded. 


(h) Vibration test. 
1. 	A fire alarm device shall be capable of withstanding vibration without false operation, without breakage or damage to parts or any leakage at fittings. Following the vibration test the response of a unit shall not show a variation of more than 50 percent from the value obtained in the oven test on as-received samples. There shall be no change in the sound intensity following the vibration. 
2. 	
Two samples are to be secured in the position of normal use on a mounting board and the board, in turn, securely fastened to a variable speed vibration machine having an amplitude of0.01 inch. The frequency ofvibration is to be varied from 10 to 35 cycles per second (cps) in increments of 5 cps until a resonant frequency is obtained. The samples are then to be vibrated at the maximum resonant frequency for a period of four hours. Ifno resonant frequency is obtained, the samples are to be vibrated at 35 cycles per second for a period of 120 hours. 

3. 	
For these tests, amplitude is defined as the maximum displacement of sinusoidal motion from a position of rest or one-half of the total table displacement. Reso­nance is defined as the maximum magnification of the applied vibration. 

4. 
Devices capable of repeated operation are to be sub­jected to the oven test before and after the vibration test. Where devices are not capable of repeated operation, the response data obtained from the oven test is to be compared to the response of identical as-received samples. 

5. 
This test is generally to be conducted only on devices of the ordinary degree rating unless there is a reason to anticipate different behavior ofother ratings. For multi­pIe station fire alarm devices, the units shall be inter­connected with a 10-foot length oftubing between units and between the units and any sounding appliance with which it is intended to be employed. 


(i) Humidity test. 
1. 	
A fire alarm device shall be capable of operating in a normal manner and comply with the requirements of the oven test following exposure for 24 hours to moist air having a relative humidity of 85 ± 5 percent at a tem­perature of 30 ± 2°C (86 ± 3.6°F). The units shall be tested within five minutes after removal from the humid environment. 

2. 	
Two samples are to be subjected to this test. This test is to be conducted on devices having an ordinary degree rating only, unless different behavior of other ratings is anticipated. 


G) Low-temperature exposure test. 
1. 	
A fire alarm device shall be capable of operating in a normal manner and comply with the requirements of the oven test following exposure for 24 hours to a tem­perature of minus 30 ± 2°C (minus 34.4 ± 3.6°F). The units shall be tested within five minutes after removal from the low temperature chamber. There shall be no false operation, damage to parts or leakage at fittings. 

2. 	
Two samples are to be subjected to this test. This test is to be conducted on devices having an ordinary degree 


rating only, unless different behavior of other ratings is anticipated. 
3. 	For a multiple station fire alarm device the maximum length oftubing specified by the manufacturer [see Sec­tion 12-72-203 (a), Item 2] is to be connected between the unit and any alarm sounding device with which it is intended to be used prior to conducting the test. 

(k) Endurance test. 
1. 	
There shall be no mechanical failure of a spring wound-type fire alarm device and the unit shall be capa­ble of operating in a normal manner and comply with the requirements of the oven test following lOO cyc1es of operation at a rate of not less than once per hour. 

2. 	
Two samples of any rating shall be SUbjected to this test. Each cyc1e shall consist of a complete rundown and rewinding operation. Following the 100 cyc1es, the units shall be subjected to the oven test. 



(1) Audibility test. 
1. 	
The audible alarm generated by a fire alarm. device shall be distinctive in sound from other customary sounds, continue for at least four fuLl minutes at full intensity and be not less than 83 decibels when measured in an ambient temperature of 23 ± 3°C (73 ± 5.4°F) with a relative humidity of 60 20 percent and a barometric pressure of approximately 700 mm mercury. 

2. 	
The measurement of sound level is to be made with a sound level meter employing the C weighting network and fast response characteristics. The measurement is to be made in a room having the approximate dimen­sions of 20-by 10-by 10-feet high or larger with sound absorbing panels on walls and ceiling having a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) of 0.95 or higher for the walls and 0.64 or higher for the ceiling. The ambient noise level shall be not greater than 55 decibels. The device is to be mounted in a position of normal use, approximately 5 feet above the floor in the center of the room. The microphone is to be located at a 10-foot dis­tance from the device and in a position to receive the maximum sound level produced by the device. 

3. 	
Alternately, the measurement may be made in a free field condition to minimize the effect ofreflected sound energy. The ambient noise level is to be at least 10 deci­bels below the measured level produced by the signal device. Free field conditions may be simulated by mounting the device not less than 10 feet from the ground and with the microphone located 10 feet from the device and conducting the test outdoors on a clear day with a wind velocity of not more than 5 miles per hour and an ambient temperature of 15-25°C (50-77°F). 

4. 	
Alternatively, an anechoic chamber of not less than 1,000 cubic feet, with no dimension less than 7 feet, and with an absorption factor of 0.99 or greater from 100 Hertz (Hz) to 10 kiloHertz (kHz) for all surfaces may be used for this measurement.

PROTECTIVE SIGNALING SYSTEMS 
internal hydrostatic pressure of five times the pressure 
of the stored gas at the operating temperature of the 
device. 
2. 	
In conducting the hydrostatic strength test, the storage cylinder is to be tested to the specified pressure after the shell has been completely filled with water or oil. Care should be exercised to expel all air from the test speci­men before the pressure is applied. 

3. 	
The apparatus for this test is to consist of a hand-or motor-operated hydraulic pump capable of producing the required test pressure, a substantial test cage capa­ble of containing the shell and its parts in the event of failure, the necessary valves and fittings for attachment to the test sample, a calibrated pressure gage graduated in at least 20 pounds per square inch (psi) increments to at least 200 psi more than the test pressure, and the nec­essary valves, fittings, etc., for regulating and maintain­ing the specified test pressure. 

4. 
The pressure should be increased at a rate of approxi­mately 300 psi per minute until the test pressure is obtained. The ultimate test pressure is to be held for one minute. 

5. 	
Five cylinders are to be subjected to this test. None of the cylinders shall rupture or show evidence ofleakage. Deformation of a cylinder is not considered a failure.

TESTING OVEN 

Sec. 12·72-206. 
(a) General. The testing oven shall be constructed and oper­ated in accordance with this section and the following: 
1. 	
A typical test oven consists of an oval shaped stainless steel box approximately 31 by 10 by 16 inches high, made of No. 11 M.S. G. material. One of the curved end sections is hinged. See Figure 12-72-2-3. 

2. 	
A section 6 by 6 inches at the top is fitted with a remov­able wooden cover. 

3. 
Two glass windows, 4 by 6 inches in size, are provided in the sides of the oven for observation of the samples under test. 


4. 
The interior ofthe oven is divided horizontally by a baf­fle over the heater chamber located in the central lower section. One end of the horizontal baffle is joined to a guide vane extending upward at an angle of 72 degrees into the oven chamber. The vane directs the air currents to ensure greater uniformity oftemperature in the oven. 

5. 
Eight 1,000-watt heating elements, threaded into screw shell lampholders, furnish the heat They are so con­nected that six ofthe heating elements are controlled by means of two manually adjusted autotransformers. An auxiliary switch controls the other two heating ele­ments for supplying additional heat when necessary. 

6. 
An air current through the bank ofheaters is created by means of a four blade five-inch diameter fan located behind the heating elements and connected to a shaft which extends to the outside of the oven. A variable speed motor is mounted on a bracket inside the lower cabinet and operates the fan through a pulley and belt arrangement The speed of the motor is adjusted and the pitch of the fan blade is such that the velocity of the air current is 230-245 feet per minute over the sample under test 

7. 
Temperatures are measured by means 	of two No. 30 AWG wire thermocouples inserted through copper tubes extending to the inside ofthe test chamber and are located adjacent to the device under test and in the heat­ing chamber. The air velocity is measured by a velometer installed in the oven. 

8. 	
A control board is mounted on the cabinet adjacent to the testing oven. The control board incorporates five toggle switches and four indicating lights for operating the heating elements, air flow fan and a cooling fan. A toggle switch is used for turning on the temperature recorder and another is used for checking the tempera­tures in either the upper or lower portion of the oven. 

9. 	
Two manually adjusted autotransformers are mounted on the control panel for controlling the heat developed by the heating coils. An air flow indicator gage is incor­porated on the control board for continuous indication ofthe air flow during the test run. In the event that the air flow tends to change during a test run, the speed of the fan is adjusted to keep the air velocity within the speci­fied range. 


(b) Test method. 
1. 	
The preparation for test consists ofmounting the device on the small removable screen base of1/4-inch hardware cloth formed to a height where the temperature sensing element is midway between the top of the chamber and the guide vane. The sample under test is positioned in the air stream so that there is no obstruction between the guide vane and sensing element. A spring wound device is mounted with the sensing element in a hori­zontal position. The test sample shall remain in the oven at least five minutes prior to starting each test run. 

2. 
The heating coils are permitted to preheat for 	10-20 seconds prior to starting the test The fan controlling the air flow is turned on and its speed adjusted to produce the required velocity. The temperatures are read every 10 seconds. The two autotransformers are adjusted as 


PROTECTIVE SIGNALING SYSTEMS 

needed to obtain the desired rate of temperature rise. 3. Upon operation of the device, the current applied to the Normal oven temperatures at the start of the test are to bank of heaters is cut-off and the oven is cooled to nor­be 85-90°F (29.4-32.2°C). mal room temperature by means of the cooling fan.

STANDARD 12-72-3 

STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
SCOPE 

Sec. 12-72-300. 
(a) 
Basic. This standard represents the minimum basic requirements for the constmction and perfonnance of combus­tion products detectors of other than the photoelectric type to be employed in ordinary indoor locations and to be listed under this classification. The minimum design, construction and per­fonnance standards set forth herein are those deemed as mini­mum necessary to establish confonnance to the regulations of the State Fire Marshal. 

(b) 
Definitions. For the purpose ofthis standard, the follow­ing definitions shall apply: 


1. 	
Alarm signaL A signal intended to indicate an emer­gency fire condition. 

2. 	
Annunciator. Integrally mounted or remotely con­nected visual indicating device intended to indicate an alann or trouble condition. 

3. 	
Ionization type detector. A device in which the pres­ence of small combustion practices, often invisible to the eye, interfere with the nonnal ionization current resulting from radiation produced by a radioactive source in the detection chamber. A second chamber, employing a similar ionization source, may also be used to compensate for normal environmental ambient changes. 

4. 
Ionization-resistance bridge type detector. Employs both ionization and resistance bridge principles in one unit. Additive response from both detector elements is required for detector operation. 


S. 	Resistance-bridge type detector. Responds to an abnonnal rate of increase of combustion products which change the impedance of second similar plate may be employed to compensate for nonnal ambient changes. 
6. 	
Sensitivity. Relative degree ofresponse ofa detector. A high sensitivity denotes response to a lower concentra­tion of combustion than a low sensitivity under identi­cal fire test conditions. 

7. 	
Trouble signal. A visual or audible signal intended to indicate a fault or trouble condition, such as an open or ground fault, occurring in the device or connected wiring. 

8. 	
Voltage classification. 


A. Low voltage. A circuit classified as low voltage is one involving a potential of not more than 30 volts alternating current (42.4 peak) or direct current, and supplied from a circuit whose power is limited to a maximum of 100 volt amperes. 
B. High voltage. A circuit classified as high voltage is one having circuit characteristics in excess of those of a low-voltage circuit.

3. 	
In determining compliance with Item 2, only uninsulated live parts in high-voltage circuits are to be considered. 

4. 
An electrical control component which may require examination, adjustment, servicing or maintenance while energized (excluding voltage measurements except for jacks or terminals specifically intended for that purpose) shall be located and moun ted with respect to other components and with respect to grounded metal parts so that it is accessible for electrical service functions without subjecting persons to the likelihood of shock hazard from adjacent uninsulated live parts or to accident hazard from adjacent hazardous moving parts. 

5. 	
Other arrangements of location of components and/or guarding are also acceptable where electrical compo­nents are accessible for service as indicated by Item 4. 

6. 
The following are not considered to be uninsulated live parts: (1) coils of controllers, relays and solenoids, and transformer windings, ifthe coils and windings are pro­vided with suitable insulating overwraps, (2) enclosed motor windings, (3) terminals and (4) splices with suit­able insulation and insulated wire.

3. 	
The through air and over surface spacings at an individ­ual component part are to be judged on the basis of the volt-amperes used and controlled by the individual component. However, the spacing from one component to another, and from any component to the enclosure or to other uninsulated dead metal parts excluding the component mounting surface, shall be judged on the basis ofthe maximum voltage and total volt -ampere rat­ing of all components in the enclosure. 

4. 
The spacing requirements in Table 12-72-3E do not apply to the inherent spacings inside motors, except at wiring terminals, or to the inherent spacings of a com­ponent which is provided as part of the detector. Such spacings are judged on the basis ofthe requirements for the component. The electrical clearance resulting from 


the assembly of a component into the complete device, including clearances to dead metal or enclosures, shall be those indicated in Table 12-72-3E. 
5. 
The "to walls 	of enclosure" spacings are not to be applied to an individual enclosure of a component part within an outer enclosure.

2. 	
The fire tests are to be conducted in a room having a smooth ceiling with no physical obstructions between the fire source and detectors and with minimum air movement. The room is to be provided with means for the removal of combustion products, such as vents or exhaust fans. Heaters are to be provided for maintaining the room temperature ambient, if necessary. The heat­ers are to be shut off during a test triaL The room shall be ofsufficient cross-sectional area so that the detectors can be located in accordance with the spacing layout illustrated by Figure 12-72-3-2 and any reflection of combustion products is prevented from returning to the detectors from adjacent walls during the course of the test. The room height shall be such that the vertical dis­tance from the base of the combustible to the ceiling is approximately 12 feet. 

3. 	
The tests are to be conducted in an ambient temperature between 15.6°C and 26.7°C (60°F and SO°F) and arela­tive humidity of50 ± 20 percent. The test samples are to 


be energized from a source of supply in accordance with Section 12-72-303 (a), Item 5. 
4. 
Four samples, each adjusted to their minimum sensitiv­ity setting, are to be installed on the ceiling at a 30-foot spacing schedule with relation to the test fire (2I.2-foot linear distance measured along the ceiling to a point directly over the center of the test fire). See Figure 12-72-3-2. The time starts at the moment ofignition. At least two trials shall be conducted for each combustible. Each detector shall respond at least once to each of the four combustibles employed. 

5. 	
Sensitivity monitoring instruments are to be employed to determine that the test room area is free ofproducts of combustion prior to conducting a test. 


U) Temperature test. 
1. 	
The materials or components employed in a detector shall not be affected adversely by the temperatures attained under any condition of normal operation. 

2. 	
A material or component will be considered as being adversely affected if it is subject to a temperature rise greater than that indicated in Table I2-72-3F. 

3. 	
The classes of material used for electrical insulation referred to in Items 8 and 9 of Table I2-72-3F include the following: 


Class A Impregnated cotton, paper and similar (Class 105) organic materials when impregnated, and enamel as applied to coil windings. 
Class B Inorganic materials, such as mica and (Class 130) impregnated asbestos. 
4. 	
All values for temperature rises apply to equipment intended for use in ambient temperatures normally prevailing which usually are not higher than 25°C (77°F). If equipment is intended specifically for use with a prevailing ambient temperature constantly more than 25°C (77°F), the test of the equipment is made at the higher ambient temperature, and the allowable temperature rises specified in the table are to be reduced by the amount ofthe difference between that higher ambient temperature and 25°C (77°F). 

5. 	
Temperature measurements on equipment intended for recessed mounting shall be made with the unit installed in an enclosure of nominal 3/4-inch wood having clearances of 2 inches on the top, sides and rear, and the front extended to be flush with the detec­tor cover. 

6. 	
A temperature is considered to be constant when three successive readings, taken at not less than five minute intervals, indicate no change. 

7. 	
Temperatures are to be measured by means of thermocouples consisting of wires not larger than No. 24 AWG. The preferred method of measuring the temperature of a coil is the thermocouple method, but a temperature measurement by either the thermocou­ple or resistance method is acceptable, except that the thermocouple method is not to be employed for a tem­perature measurement at any point where supplemen­tary thermal insulation is employed. 


8. 	
If thermocouples are used in the determination of temperatures, it is standard practice to employ thermocouples consisting of No. 24-30 AWG iron and constantan wires and a potentiometer type indi­cating instrument. Such equipment will be used whenever referee temperature measurements by thermocouples are necessary. 

9. 	
The thermocouple wire is to conform with the requirements for "special" thermocouples as listed in the Table of Limits of Error of Thermocouples in ANSI C96.I-I964 (RI969). 

10. 
The temperature of a copper coil winding is deter­mined by the resistance method by comparing the resistance of the winding at the temperature to be determined with the resistance at a known tempera­ture by means of the equation: 


TE (RJr) (234.5 + t) -234.5 

where: 
T  = is the temperature to be determined in degrees C.  
t  is the known temperature in degrees C.  
R  is the resistance in ohms at the temperature to be determined.  
r  is the resistance in ohms at the known temperature.  
11. As it is generally necessary to de-energize the wind­ing before measuring R, the value of R at shutdown may be determined by taking several resistance mea­surements at short intervals, beginning as quickly as possible after the instant of shutdown. A curve of the resistance values and the time may be plotted and extrapolated to give the value of R at shutdown.  
12. To determine compliance with this test, a detector is to be connected to a source of supply in accordance with Section 12-72-303 (a), Item 5, and operated under the following conditions:  
A. Normal standby-(l6 hours) constant tempera­ 
tures.  
B. Alarm-(1 hour).  
C. Alarm-(7 hours) abnormal test.  
13. For test condition C the temperature limits may be exceeded but there shall be no manifestation of a fire  
hazard or approaching failure and the detector shall operate in a normal manner following the test.  
14. The detector is to be subjected to the Dielectric With­stand Test following the above test.

The test flame is to be applied at an angle of 20 degrees from the vertical to any portion of the interior of the enclosure judged as liable to be ignited by proximity to live or arcing parts, coils, wiring, etc. The test flame shall be applied to a different location on each of the three samples tested. The test flame is to be applied for five seconds and removed for five sec­onds. The operation is to be repeated until the specimen has been subjected to a total of five applications of the test flame. 

(f) 
Impact test. An appliance employing a thermoplastic enclosure shall withstand three 5 foot-pound impacts without exposure oflive parts, impairment of the operation of the appli­ance or result in a shock hazard. 


Each of two units is to be mounted securely in a position of normal use on a surface representative of a typical installation. Three 5 foot-pound impacts are to be applied to each sample, each trial on a different section of the enclosure, by means of a 
1.18 pound, 2-inch diameter steel sphere swung through a pen­dulum arc from a sufficient height to apply 5 foot-pounds of energy. 
PROTECTIVE SIGNALING SYSTEMS 

Following the impacts, the unit is to be examined for damage and checked for normal operation by being energized from a source of rated voltage and frequency. Cracking of the enclo­sure is acceptable ifit does not impair normal operation, but is not acceptable ifa dust or moisture tight enclosure is required. 
(g) 
Infrared analysis of plastics. The basic composition of a plastic material employed for the sole support ofcurrent car­rying parts or an enclosure is to be by infrared analysis. 

(h) 
Sample preparation. The general technique for prepar­ing plastics for infrared analysis is to dissolve the sample in a suitable boiling hot solvent. The resulting solution is then to be placed on a sodium chloride plate from which the solvent is evaporated by gentle heating, thereby leaving a reasonably uni­form thin film of the plastic on the sodium chloride plate. The salt plate is then mounted in a spectrometer and the infrared spectrum of the plastic is recorded. 


A suitable solvent is one which will dissolve the plastic with­out reacting with it and which can be readily evaporated on gentle heating. 
Examples ofsolvents suitable for certain polymer types are: 
acetone-for polymers of high oxygen content, e.g., 
polyesters and phenolic resins. 
o-dichlorobenzene-for simple vinyl type polymers 
e.g., polyvinylchlorides. 
n,n-dimethylformamide-for polymers of nitrogen content, e.g., polyamides. 

Some high molecular weight or highly cross-linked poly­mers which are insoluble in all volatile solvents are to be pre­pared by the pressed halide-disk technique. A few milligrams ofthe plastic are to be removed from the surface ofa sample by a fine file. These filings are to be ground in a mechanical vibrat­ing ball mill for three to five minutes. Care must be taken to reduce the particle size to a size (approximately 2 micrometers) smaller than that ofthe shortest wave length to be scanned so as to minimize scattering effects. The appropriately ground sam­ple is to be intimately mixed with spectroscopic grade potas­sium bromide and a sufficient amount of this mixture to produce a 1 mm thick, l/r inch diameter disk is to be placed in an evacuable die. The die is to be placed under vacuum and a pressure of 10,000-15,000 psi is to be applied. The pressed disk is removed from the die and mounted in a spectrometer, and the infrared spectrum of the plastic is recorded.

micrometers (5000-667 cm-) of a given plastic is to be obtained on an optical double beam recording infrared spec­trometer, having either a grating or sodium chloride prism dis­persing element.
