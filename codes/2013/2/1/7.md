SECTION 703
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS

703.1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 119 or UL 263 or in accordance with Section 703.3. Where materials, systems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the building element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall be made available to the building official to show that the required fire-resistance rating is not reduced. Materials and methods of construction used to protect joints and penetrations in fire-resistance-rated building elements, components or assemblies shall not reduce the required frre-resistance rating.
Exception: In determining the frre-resistance rating of exterior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E 119 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period of time corresponding to the required frre-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same group. When the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with


2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES







ASTM E 119 or UL263, the fire exposure time period, water pressure and application duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E 119 or UL 263 shall be based upon the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception.
703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263. When evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for exterior walls).
703.2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.
703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-resistance-rated assemblies tested under ASTM E 119 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the building official is furnished by the registered design professional showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be identified on the plans.
703.3 Alternative methods for determining fire resistance.
The application of any of the alternative methods listed in this section shall be based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 263. The required fire resistance of a building element, component or assembly shall be permitted to be established by any of the following methods or procedures:
1.
Fire-resistance designs documented in sources.

2.
Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building elements, components or assemblies as prescribed in Section 721.

3.
Calculations in accordance with Section 722.

4.
Engineering analysis based on a comparison of building element, component or assemblies designs having fire-resistance ratings as determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 119 or UL 263.

5.
Alternative protection methods as allowed by Section


104.11.
703.4 Automatic sprinklers. Under the prescriptive fireresistance requirements of the California Building Code, the fire-resistance rating of a building element, component or assembly shall be established without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other fire suppression system being incorporated as part of the assembly tested in accordance with the fire exposure, procedures, and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 263. However, this section shall not prohibit or limit the duties and powers of the building official allowed by Sections 104. 10 and 104.11.
703.5 Noncombustibility tests. The tests indicated in Sections 703.5.1 and 703.5.2 shall serve as criteria for acceptance of building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2,
602.3 and 602.4 in Type I, II, illand IV construction. The term "noncombustible" does not apply to the flame spread characteristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material shall not be classified as a noncombustible building construction material if it is subject to an increase in combustibility or flame spread beyond the limitations herein established through the effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric conditions.
703.5.1 Elementary materials. Materials required to be noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E 136.
703.5.2 Composite materials. Materials having a structural base of noncombustible material as determined in accordance with Section 703.5.1 with a surfacing not more than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) thick that has a flame spread index not greater than SOwhen tested in accordance with ASTM E 84 or UL 723 shall be acceptable as noncombustible materials.

722.2.1.4.1 Nontire-exposed side. Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and finish determined from Table
722.2.1.1, Figure 722.2.1.2 or Table 722.2.1.2(1).
FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES
722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the frre-resistance rating determined from Table 722.2. 1.1 or Figure 722.2.1.2, or Table 722.2.1.2(1) for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in Section
722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.
722.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemblies. For a wall having no finish on one side or different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side.
