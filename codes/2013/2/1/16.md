Where buildings or structures have two or more portions that are structurally separated, each portion
shall be separately classified. Where a separated portion of a building or structure provides required access to, required egress from or shares life safety components with another portion having a higher risk category, both portions shall be assigned to the higher risk category.
1604.6 In-situ load tests. The building official is authorized to require an engineering analysis or a load test, or both, of any construction whenever there is reason to question the safety of the construction for the intended occupancy. Engi�neering analysis and load tests shall be conducted in accor�dance with Section 1709.
1604.7 Preconstruction load tests. Materials and methods of construction that are not capable of being designed by approved engineering analysis or that do not comply with the applicable referenced standards, or alternative test procedures
in accordance with Section 1707, shall be load tested in accordance with Section 1710.

See Sec�tions 1609 for wind design requirements and 1613 for earthquake design requirements.
1604.8.3 Decks. Where supported by attachment to an exterior wall, decks shall be positively anchored to the primary structure and designed for both vertical and lat�eral loads as applicable. Such attachment shall not be accomplished by the use of toenails or nails subject to withdrawal. Where positive connection to the primary building structure cannot be verified during inspection, docks shall be self-supporting. Connections of decks with cantilevered framing members to exterior walls or other framing members shall be designed for both of the follow�ing:
1.
The reactions resulting from the dead load and live load specified in Table 1607.1, or the snow load specified in Section 1608, in accordance with Sec�tion 1605, acting on all portions of the deck.

SECTION 161 0
SOIL LATERAL LOADS

1610.1 General. Foundation walls and retaining walls shall be designed to resist lateral soil loads. Soil loads specified in Table 1610.1 shall be used as the minimum design lateral soil loads unless determined otherwise by a geotechnical investi�gation in accordance with Section 1803. Foundation walls and other walls in which horizontal movement is restricted at the top shall be designed for at-rest pressure. Retaining walls free to move and rotate at the top shall be permitted to be designed for active pressure. Design lateral pressure from surcharge loads shall be added to the lateral earth pressure load. Design lateral pressure shall be increased if soils at the site are expansive. Foundation walls shall be designed to sup�port the weight of the full hydrostatic pressure of undrained backfill unless a drainage system is installed in accordance with Sections 1805.4.2 and 1805.4.3.
Exception: Foundation walls extending not more than 8 feet (2438 mm) below grade and laterally supported at the

top by flexible diaphragms shall be pennitted to be designed for active pressure.
SECTION 1611
RAIN LOADS


1611.1 Design rain loads. Each portion of a roof shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on it if the primary drainage system for that portion is blocked plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow. The design rainfall shall be based on the 100-year hourly rainfall rate indicated in Figure 1611.1 or on other rainfall rates detennined from approved local weather data.


R = 5.2(d, + dh) 	(Equation 16-36)
For SI: R = 0.0098(d, + db)
where:
dh = 	Additional depth of water on the undeflected roof above the inlet of secondary drainage system at its design flow (i.e., the hydraulic head), in inches (mm).
d, = 	Depth of water on the undeflected roof up to the inlet of secondary drainage system when the primary drainage system is blocked (i.e., the static head), in inches (mm).
R = 	Rain load on the undeflected roof, in psf (k:N/m2). When the phrase "undeflected roof' is used, deflections from loads (including dead loads) shall not be considered when detennining the amount of rain on the roof.
1611.2 Ponding instability. Susceptible bays of roofs shall be evaluated for ponding instability in accordance with Sec�tion 8.4 of ASCE 7.
1611.3 Controlled drainage. Roofs equipped with hardware to control the rate of drainage shall be equipped with a sec�ondary drainage system at a higher elevation that limits accu�mulation of water on the roof above that elevation. Such roofs shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on them to the elevation of the secondary drain�age system plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow detennined from Section 1611.1. Such roofs shall also be checked for ponding instability in accordance with Section 161 1.2.

Soil loads speci�fied in Table 1610A. l shall be used as the minimum design lateral soil loads unless determined otherwise by a geotechni�cal investigation in accordance with Section 1803A. Founda�tion walls and other walls in which horizontal movement is restricted at the top shall be designed for at-rest pressure. Retaining walls free to move and rotate at the top shall be permitted to be designed for active pressure. Design lateral pressure from surcharge loads shall be added to the lateral earth pressure load. Design lateral pressure shall be increased if soils at the site are expansive. Foundation walls shall be designed to support the weight of the full hydrostatic pressure of undrained backfill unless a drainage system is installed in accordance with Sections 1805A.4.2 and 1805A.4.3.

SECTION 1611 A
RAIN LOADS


1611A.l Design rain loads. Each portion of a roof shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on it if the primary drainage system for that portion is blocked plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow. The design rainfall shall be based on the 100-year hourly rainfall rate indicated in Figure 161 1A. l or on other rainfall rates determined from approved local weather data.
R = 5.2(ds + dh) 	(Equation 16A-36)
For SI: R = 0.0098(ds + dh)
where: dh = Additional depth of water on the undeflected roof above the inlet of secondary drainage system at its design flow (i.e., the hydraulic head), in inches (rom).
ds = 	Depth of water on the undeflected roof up to the inlet of secondary drainage system when the primary drainage system is blocked (i.e., � the static head), in inches (mm).
R = 	Rain load on the undeflected roof, in psf (kN/m2). When the phrase "undeflected roof' is used, deflections from loads (including dead loads) shall not be considered when determining the amount of rain on the roof.
1611A.2 Pouding instability. Susceptible bays of roofs shall
be evaluated for ponding instability in accordance with Sec�tion 8.4 of ASCE 7.
1611A.3 Controlled drainage. Roofs equipped with hard�ware to control the rate of drainage shall be equipped with a
