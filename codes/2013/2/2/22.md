Inelastic Rotation: The permanent or plastic portion of the rotation angle between a beam and the column, or between a link and the column of the test specimen, mea�sured in radians. The inelastic rotation shall be computed based upon an analysis of the test specimen deformations. Sources of inelastic rotation include yielding of members and connectors, yielding of connection elements and slip between members and connection elements. For beam-to�column moment connections in special moment frames, the inelastic rotation is represented by the plastic chord rotation angle calculated as the plastic deflection of the beam or girder, at the center of its span divided by the dis�tance between the center of the beam span and the center�line of the panel zone of the beam-column connection. For link-to-column connections in eccentrically braced
frames, inelastic rotation shall be computed based upon the assumption that inelastic action is concentrated at a single point located at the intersection of the centerline of the link with the face of the column.
