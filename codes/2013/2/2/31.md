CHAPTER 31 F [SLC]
MARINE OIL TERMINALS

Division I


SECTION 3101F [SLC] INTRODUCTION
3101F.1 General. The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand oil spill pre�vention and response act of 1990 (act), as amended, authorized the California State Lands Commission (SLC) to regulate marine oil terminals (MOTs) in order to protect public health, safety and the environment. The authority for this regulation is contained in Sections 8755 and 8756 of the California Public Resources Code. This act defines "oil" as any kind of petro�leum, liquid hydrocarbons, or petroleum products or any .frac�tion or residues thereof, including but not limited to, crude oil, bunker fuel, gasoline, diesel .fuel, aviation .fuel, oil sludge, oil refuse, oil mixed with waste, and liquid distillates from unpro�cessed natural gas. The provisions of this chapter regulate marine oil terminals as defined under this act.
3101F.2 Purpose. The purpose of this code is to establish mini�mum engineering, inspection and maintenance criteria for MOTs in order to prevent oil spills and to protect public health, safety and the environment. This code does not, in general, address operational requirements. Relevant provisions from existing codes, industry standards, recommended practices, regulations and guidelines have been incorporated directly or through reference, as part of this code.
Where there are differing requirements between this code and/or references cited herein, the choice of application shall be subject to approval of the Marine Facilities Division (Divi�sion) of the SLC.
>
3101 F.3 Applicability. The provisions of this chapter are appli�cable to the evaluation of existing MOTs and design of new MOTs in California. Each provision is classified as New (N), Existing (E), or Both (NIE) and shall be applied accordingly. if no classification is indicated, the classification shall be consid�ered to be (NIE).
Existing (E) requirements apply to MOTs that are in opera�tion on the date this code is adopted. For these MOTs, equiva�lent or in-kind replacement of existing equipment, short pipeline sections, or minor modification of existing compo�nents shall also be subject to the existing (E) requirements.
New (N) requirements apply to:
1.
A MOT or berthing system (Subsection 3102F.1.3) that commences or recommences operation with a new or modified operations manual after adoption of this code.

2.
Addition of new structural components or systems at an existing MOT that are structurally independent of exist�ing components or systems.

3.
Addition of new (nonreplacement) equipment, piping, pipelines, components or systems to an existing MOT.

4.
Major repairs or substantially modified in-place systems.

5.
Any associated major installations or modifications.


3101F.4 Overview. This Code ensures that a MOT can be safely operated within its inherent structural and equipment-related constraints.
Section 3102F defines minimum requirements for audit, inspection and evaluation of the structural, electrical and mechanical systems on a prescribed periodic basis, or follow�ing a significant, potentially damage-causing event.

Section 3 103F, 3104F and 3 107F provide criteria for structural loading, deformation and performance-based evaluation consider�ing earthquake, wind, wave, current, seiche and tsunami tffects.
Section 3105F provides requirements for the safe mooring and berthing of tank vessels and barges.
Section 3106F describes requirements for geotechnical haz�ards and .foundation analyses, including consideration of slope stability and soil .failure.
Section 31 08F provides requirements .forfire prevention, detec�tion and suppression including appropriate water and .foam vol�umes.
Sections 31 09F through 3111 F provide requirements for piping! I I pipelines, mechanical andelectrical equipment and electrical systems.
English units are prescribed herein; however, many of the units in the references are in System International (Sf).
3101F.S Risk reduction strategies. Risk reduction strategies, such as pipeline segmentation devices, system flexibility and spill containment devices may be used to reduce the size of a potential oil spill. Such strategies may reduce the MOT risk classification as determined from Table 31 F-4-1.

3101F.6 Review requirements.
3101F.6.1 Quality assurance. All audits, inspections, engi�neering analyses or design shall be reviewed by a profes�sional having similar or higher qualifications as the person who performed the work, to ensure quality assurance. This review may be performed in-house.
Peer review is required for nonlinear dynamic structural analyses and alternative lateral force procedures not pre�scribed herein. The peer review may be from an independent internal or external source. The peer reviewer shall be a California registered civil or structural engineer.
3101F.6.2 Division review. The following will be subject to review for compliance with this code by the Division or its authorized representative( s):
1.
Any audit, inspection, analysis or evaluation of MOTs.

2.
Any significant change, modification or re-design of a structural, mooring, fire, piping/pipelines, mechanical or electrical system at an MOT, prior to use or reuse.

3.
Engineering analysis and design for any new MOT prior to construction. Also see Section 3102F.3.3. 1.

4.
Construction inspection team and the construction inspection report(s).


3101F.7 Alternatives. In special circumstances where certain requirements of these standards cannot be met, altenzatives that provide an equal or better protection of the public health, safety and the environment shall be subject to Division Chief approval with concurrence of the Division 's lead engineer in responsible charge.
Authority: Sections 8755 and 8757, Public Resources Code. Reference: Sections 8750, 8751, 8755 and 8757, Public Resources Code.

SECTION 3102F AUDIT AND INSPECTION


3102F.l General.
3102Rl.l Purpose. Section 3102F defines minimum require�ments for audit, inspection, and evaluation of the structura mechanical and electrical components and systems.
3102R1.2 Audit and inspections types. The audit and inspections described in this Chapter (31F) and 2 CCR 2320 (a) and (b) [2.1] are:
1.
Annual inspection

2.
Audit

3.
Post-event inspection


Each has a distinct purpose and is conducted either at a

> 	defined interval (see Table 31F-2-1 and Section 3102F.3.3.2), as a result of a significant, potentially dam�age-causing event or a significant change in operations. In the time between audits and inspections, operators are expected to conduct periodic walk-down examinations of the Mar to detect potentially unsafe conditions.

3102R1.3 Berthing systems. For the purpose of assigning structural ratings and documenting the condition of mechanical and electrical systems, an MOT shall be divided into independent "berthing systems." A berthing system consists of the wharf and supporting structure, mechanical and electrical components that serve the berth and pipeline systems as defined in Title 2 CCR �2560 and 256I(n).
For example, a Mar consisting of wharves with three berths adjacent to the shoreline could contain three independent "berthing systems " ifthe piping does not route through adja�cent berths. Therefore, a significant defect that would restrict the operation of one berth would have no impact on the other two berths. Conversely, ifa T-head Pier, with multiple berths sharing a trestle that supports all piping to the shoreline, had a significant deficiency on the common trestle, the operation of all berths could be adversely impacted. This configuration is classified as a single berthing system.
The physical boundaries of a berthing system may exclude unused sections of a structure. Excluded sections must be physically isolated from the berthing system. Expansion joints may provide this isolation.
3102R1.4 Records. All Mars shall have records reflecting current, as-built conditions for all berthing systems. Records shall include, but not be limited to modifications and/or replacement of structural components, electrical or mechanical equipment or relevant operational changes, new construction including design drawings, calculations, engineering analyses, soil borings, equipment manuals, specifications, shop drawings, technical and maintenance manuals and documents.
Chronological records and reports of annual inspections, audits and post-event inspections and documentation of equipment or structural changes shall be maintained.
Records shall be indexed and be readily accessible to the Division (see 2 CCR Section 2320 (c) (2)) [2.1].
3102F.1.5 Baseline inspection. If "as-built" or subsequent modification drawings are not available, incomplete or inac�curate, a baseline inspection is required to gather data in suf
ficient detail for adequate evaluaton.
The level of detail required shall be such that structural member sizes, connection and reinforcing details are docu�mented, if required in the structural analysis. In addition, the strength and/or ductility characteristics of construction materials shall be determined, as appropriate. Nondestruc�tive testing, partially destructive testing and/or laboratory testing methods may be used.
All fire, piping, mechanical and electrical systems shall be documented as to location, capacity, operating limits and
physical conditions.
3102F.2 Annual inspection. The annual inspection required by 2 CCR 2320 (a)( 1) [2.1], may include an engineering exam�ination of the topside and underside areas of the dock, includ�ing the splash zone. The Division shall perform the inspection, with cooperation from the owner/operator. Observations will be recorded and a report of violations and deficiencies shall be provided to the operator.
Subject to operating procedures, a boat shall be provided to facilitate the inspection of the dock undersides and piles down to the splash zone. Ifa boat is not available or the under dock inspection cannot be performed by the Division during the annual inspection, the MOT operator shall carry out or cause to be carried out, such an inspection. The .operator will then provide the Division with a report detailing the examination results including photographs, videos and sketches as neces�sary to accurately depict the state of the underside of the dock.
3102F.3 Audits.
3102F.3.1 Objective. The objective of the audit is to review structural, mechanical and electrical systems on a pre�scribed periodic basis to verify that each berthing system is fit for its specific defined purpose.
3102F.3.2 Overview. The audit shall include above water and underwater inspections, and structural, electrical and mechanical systems evaluations, with supporting documen�tation, drawings and follow-up actions. Structural systems shall include seismic, operational, mooring, berthing and geotechnical considerations. Mechanical systems shall include fire, piping/pipelines and mechanical equipment considerations. The audit is performed by a multi-disciplin�ary team of engineers, qualified inspectors and may include Division representatives.
The above water inspection involves an examination of all structural, mechanical and electrical components above the waterline. Structural defects and their severity shall be doc�umented, but the exact size and location of each deficiency is typically not required.

The underwater structural inspection shall include the Level I, II and III inspection efforts, as shown in Tables 31F-2-2 and 31F-2-3. The underwater inspection levels of effort are described below, per [2.2]:
Level /-Includes a close visual examination, or a tactile examination using large sweeping motions of the hands where visibility is limited. Although the Level Ieffort is often referred to as a "swim-by " inspection, it must be detailed enough to detect obvious major damage or deterioration due to overstress or other severe deterioration. It should confirm the continuity of the full length of all members and detect undermining or exposure of normally buried ele�ments. A Level I effort may also include limited probing of the substructure and adjacent channel bottom.
Level II-A detailed inspection which requires marine growth removal from a representative sampling of compo�nents within the structure. For piles, a 12-inch high band should be cleaned at designated locations, generally near the low waterline, at the mud-line, and midway between the low waterline and the mudline. On a rectangular pile, the marine growth removal should include at least three sides; on an octagon pile, at least six sides; on a round pile, at least three-fourths of the perimeter. On large diam�eter piles, 3ft or greater, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 ft by 1 ft areas at four locations approxi�mately equally spaced around the perimeter, at each ele�vation. On large solid faced elements such as retaining structures, marine growth removal should be effected on 1
ft by 1ft areas at the three specified elevations. The inspec�
tion should also focus on typical areas of weakness, such
as attachment points and welds. The Level II effort is

cant damage to the encasement is present, or if evi�dence of significant deterioration of the underlying component is present, then the damage evaluation should consider whether the encasement was provided
for protection and/or structural capacity. Encasements should not typically be removed for an audit.
For encasements on which the formwork has been left in place, the inspection should focus on the integ�rity of the encasement, not the formwork. Levell and Level II efforts in such cases should concentrate on the top and bottom of the encasement. For concrete com�ponents, if deterioration, loss of bonding, or other sig�nificant problems with the encasement are suspected, it may be necessary to conduct a special inspection, including coring of the encasement and laboratory evaluation of the materials.
3102R3.5.3.3 Wrapped components. For steel, con�crete or timber components that have been wrapped, the Level l and II efforts should focus on the evaluation of the integrity of the wrap. Since the effectiveness of a wrap may be compromised by removal, and since the removal and re-installation of wraps is time-consum�ing, it should not be routinely done. However, if evi�dence of significant damage exists, or if the effectiveness of the wraps is in question, then samples should be removed to facilitate the inspection and eval�uation. The samples may be limited to particular zones or portions of members if damage is suspected, based on the physical evidence of potential problems. A mini�mum sample size of three members should be used. A
five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit.
For wrapped timber components, Level Ill efforts should consist of removal of the wraps from a represen�tative sample of components in order to evaluate the condition of the timber beneath the wrap. The sample may be limited to particular zones or portions of the members if damage is suspected (e.g., at the mudline/ bottom of wrap or in the tidal zone). The sample size should be determined based on the physical evidence of potential problems and the aggressiveness of the environment. A minimum sample size of three members should be used. A five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit.

and methodology of any supplemental inspections (e.g., special inspections (see Section 3102F.3.5.3).
The following information may be important in determining the need for, and methodology of, the post-event inspection:
1. 	Earthquakes or vessel or debris impact typically cause damage both above and below the waterline.

II
Following a major earthquake, the inspection should
focus on components likely to attract highest lateral loads (batter or shorter piles in the rear of the struc�ture, etc.). In case of vessel or debris impact, the inspection effort should focus on components in the path of the impact mass.

2.
Major floods or tsunamis may cause undermining of II the structure, and/or scouring at the mudline.

3.
Fire damage varies significantly with the type of con�struction materials but all types may be adversely affected. Special inspections (sampling and labora�tory testing) shall be conducted, as determined by the inspection team leader, in order to determine the nature and extent of damage.

4.
High wind or wave events often cause damage both above and below the waterline. An underwater inspec�



II
tion may be required if damage is visible above the water�line. Structural damage may be potentially increased if a vessel was at the berth during the event. The effects of high wind may be most prevalent on equipment and con�nections of such equipment to the structure.

The methodology of conducting an underwater post-event inspection should be established with due consideration of the structure type and type of damage anticipated. Whereas slope failures or scour may be readily apparent in waters of adequate visibility, overstressing cracks on piles covered with marine growth will not be readily apparent. Where such hid�den damage is suspected, marine growth removal should be performed on a representative sampling of components in accordance with the Level II effort requirements described in Section 3 102F.3 .5.2. The cause of the event will determine the appropriate sample size and locations.
3102F.4.4 Post-event ratings. A post-event rating [2.2] shall be assigned to each berthing system upon completion of the inspection (see Table 3IF-2-9). All observations of the above and under water structure, mechanical and elec�trical components and systems shall be considered in assigning a post-event rating.

Ratings should consider only damage that was likely caused by the event. Pre-existing deterioration such as cor�rosion damage should not be considered unless the struc�tural integrity is immediately threatened or safety systems or protection of the environment may be compromised.
Assignment of ratings should reflect an overall character�ization of the berthing system being rated. The rating shall consider both the severity of the deterioration and the extent to which it is widespread throughout the facility. The fact that the facility was designed for loads that are lower than the current standards for design should have no influence upon the ratings.
3102F.4.5 Follow-up actions. Follow-up actions shall be assigned upon completion of the post-event inspection of





each berthing system. Table 3IF-2-5 specifies remedial
action priorities for deficiencies. Table 31F-2-6 specifies
various follow-up actions. Multiple follow-up actions may
be assigned; however, guidance should be provided as to the
order in which the follow-up actions should be carried-out.
Follow-up actions shall be subject to Division approval.


3102F.4.6 Documentation and reporting. Documentation
of the specific attributes of each defect shall not be required
during a post-event inspection. However, a narrative
description of significant damage shall be used. The
description shall be consistent with and shall justify the
post-event rating assigned.

STRUCTURAL LOADING CRITERIA


3103F.l General. Section 3103F establishes the environmen�tal and operating loads acting on the marine oil terminal (MOT) structures and on moored vessel( s ). The analysis proce�dures are presented in Sections 3104F -3107F.
3103F.2 Dead loads.
3103F.2.1 GeneraL Dead loads shall include the weight of the entire structure, including permanent attachments such as loading arms, pipelines, deck crane, fire monitor tower, gang-. way strncture, vapor control equipment and mooring hard�ware. Unit weights specified in Section 31 03F.2.2 may be used
for MOT strnctures if actual weights are not available.

***pounds per square foot
3103F.3 Live loads and buoyancy. The following vertical live loading shall be considered, where appropriate: uniform load�ing, truck loading, crane loading and buoyancy. Additionally, MOT specific, nonpermanent equipment shall be identified and used in loading computations.
3103F.4 Earthquake loads.
3103F.4.1 GeneraL Earthquake loads are described in terms of Peak Ground Acceleration ( PGA), spectral acceleration and earthquake magnitude. The required seismic analysis procedures (Tables 31 F -4-2 and 31 F-4-3) are dependent on the risk classification obtained from Table 31 F -4-1.

3103F.4.2 Design earthquake motion parameters. The earthquake ground motion parameters of peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration and earthquake magni�tude are modified for site amplification and near fault directivity effects. The resulting values are the design peak ground acceleration (DPGA), design spectral acceleration (DSA) and design earthquake magnitude (DEM).
� The peak ground and spectral acceleration may be evalu�ated using:
1.
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) or California Geo�logical Survey [CGS, formerly the California Divi�sion of Mines and Geology (CDMG)] maps as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.2,

2.
A site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.3.

3.
For the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme, PSHA results are provided
in Section 3103F.4.2.3.


Unless stated otherwise, the DSA values are for 5 percent damping; values at other levels may be obtained as per Sec�tion 3103F.4.2.9.
The appropriate probability levels associated with DPGA and DSA for different seismic performance levels are pro�vided in Table 31F-4 -2. Deterministic earthquake motions, which are used only for comparison to the probabilistic results, are addressed in Section 3103F.4.2. 7.
The evaluation of Design Earthquake Magnitude (DEM), is discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.8. This parameter is required when acceleration time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10) are addressed or if liquefaction potential (Section 3106F.3) is being evaluated.
3103F.4.2.1 Site classes. The following site classes, defined in Section 31 06F.2, shall be used in developing values of DSA and DPGA:
SA, SIP S0 Sv, SE and Sp
For SF> a site-specific response analysis is required per Section 3103F.4.2.5.
3103F.4.2.2 Earthquake motions from USGS maps.
Earthquake ground motion parameters can be obtained from the Maps 29-32 in the National Earthquake Haz�ard Reduction Program (NEHRP) design map set dis�cussed in subsection 1.6.1 of [3.1], or the USGS web�site: (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/hazmapsl). These are available as peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values at 5 percent damping for 10 and 2 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years, which correspond to Average Return Periods (ARPs) of 475 and 2,475 years, respectively. The spectral acceler�ation values are available for 0.2, and 1.0 second spec�tral periods. In obtaining peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values from the USGS web site, the site location can be specified in terms of site longi�tude and latitude or the zip code when appropriate. The

resulting values of peak ground acceleration and spec�
tral acceleration correspond to surface motions for Site
Classification approximately corresponding to the




boundary of Site Class SB and S0
Once peak ground acceleration and spectral accelera�tion values are obtained for 10 and 2 percent probability of exceedence in 50 years, the corresponding values for other probability levels may be obtained. A procedure is presented in subsection 1.6 of Chapter 1 of�3.1].
3103F.4.2.3 Earthquake motionsfrom site-specific probabilistic seismic ha:rJud analyses. Peak ground accel�eration and spectral acceleration values can be obtained using site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). In this approach, the seismic sources and their characterization used in the analysis shall be based on the published data from the California Geological Survey, which can be obtained online at the following website: (http://www.conservation.ca.gov/CGS/PagesHndex.aspx) [3.2].
Appropriate attenuation relationships shall be used to obtain values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at the ground surface for site conditions corre�sponding to the boundary ofSite Class SBand s" regardless of the actual subsurface conditions at the site. These results shall be compared to those based on the FEMAIUSGS maps discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.2. If the two sets of values are significantly different, a justification for using the characterization chosen shall be provided.
Alternatively, peak ground acceleration and spectral accelerations at the ground surface for the subsurface conditions that actually exist at the site may be directly

obtained by using appropriate attenuation relationships
in a site-specific PSHA. This approach is not permissible for Site Classes S E and SF-
For site-specific PSHA, peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values corresponding to the seis�mic performance level (See Table 31F-4-2) shall be obtained.
For peak ground acceleration, PSHA may be conducted using the "magnitude weighting" procedure in Idriss [3.3]. The actual magnitude weighting values should fol�low the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) procedures [3.4]. This magnitude weighting procedure incorporates the effects of duration corresponding to vari�ous magnitude events in the PSHA.results. The resulting peak ground acceleration shall be used only for liquefac�tion assessment (see Section 3106F.4).
PSHA have been developed for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach [3.5, 3.6] and provide site-spe�cific information for seismic analyses. Table 31F-3-3 provides response spectra, for a 475 year return period earthquake and 5 percent critical damping. Figure 31F-3-1 provides the corresponding spectra for the two ports. Additionally, these references provide spectra for return periods from 72 to 2,500 years.
For the port of Port Hueneme, a PSHA was performed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [3. 7] and the results are shown in Table 31F-3-4 and Figure 31 F -3-2. These results are provided only for site classifi�cation "Sc" and five percent critical damping. To obtain appropriate values for piles and/or the mudline, the sim�plified procedures of Section 3103F.4.2.4 may be used.

3103F.4.2.4 Simplified evaluation of site amplification effects. When the MOT Site Class is different from the S8 �Sc boundary, site amplification effects shall be incorpo�rated in peak ground accelerations and spectral acceler�ations. This may be accomplished using a simplified method or a site-specific evaluation (Section 3103F.4.2.5).
For a given site class, the following procedure [3. 1] presents a simplified method that may be used to incor�porate the site amplification effects for peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration computed for the S8 and Sc boundary.
1. 	Calculate the spectral acceleration values at 0.20
and 1.0 second period:
Sxs =FaSs  (3-1)
Sxl =F. Sl  (3-2)
where:

Fa = 	site coefficient obtained from Table 31F-3-5
F. = 	site coefficient obtained from Table 31F-3-6
S8 = short period (usually at 0.20 seconds) spectral acceleration value (for the boundary of S8 and Sc) obtained using Section 3103F.4.2.2, or at the period corresponding to the peak in spec�tral acceleration values when obtained from Section 3103F.4.2.3

sl = 	spectral acceleration value (for the boundary
of S8 and Sc) at 1.0 second period

Sxs= 	spectral acceleration value obtained using the

short period S, and factored by Table 31F-3-5
for the Site Class under consideration.


Sx1 = spectral acceleration value obtained using the
1.0
second period S1 and factored by Table 31F-3-6 for the Site Class under consider�ation.

2.
SetPGAx =0.4Sxs 	(3-3)



where:
PG4x = peak ground acceleration corresponding to
the Site Class under consideration.


When the value of PGAx is less than the peak ground acceleration obtained following Section 3103F.4.2.2 or Section 3103F.4.2.3, an explanation of the results shall be provided.
3.
PGAx, SXS> and Sx1 constitute three spectral accel�
eration values for the Site Class under consider�
ation corresponding to periods ofO, S8 (usually 0.2
seconds), and 1.0 second, respectively.


4.
The final response spectra, without consideration
for near-fault directivity effects, values of Sa for



the Site Class under consideration may be obtained using the following equations (for 5 per�cent critical damping):
for 	0 < T < 0.2T0

(3-4)
where:
T = Period corresponding to calculated Sa
T0 = 	Period at which the constant acceleration and

constant velocity regions of the design spec�trum intersect
for 	0.2T0 < T< T0
0
Sa=Sxs 	(3-5)
for 	T> T0
Sa=Sx/f' 	(3-6)
CJ
where:
T0 = Sx/Sxs 	(3-7)

The resulting PGAx is the DPGA. However, the Sa (except for the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme) shall be modified for near-fault directivity effects, per Section 3103F.4.2. 6 to obtain the


final DSAs.

3103F.4.2.5 Site-specific evaluation ofamplification effects. As an alternative to the procedure presented in Section 31 03F.4.2.4, a site-specific response analysis may be performed.

The analysis shall be either an equivalent linear or nonlinear analysis. Appropriate acceleration time his�tories as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.10 shall be used.
In general, an equivalent linear analysis using, for example, SHAKE91 [3.8] is acceptable when the strength and stiffness of soils are unlikely to change significantly during the seismic shaking, and the level of shaking is not large. A nonlinear analysis should be used when the strength and/or stiffness of soils could significantly change during the seismic shaking or significant nonlinearity of soils is expected because of high seismic shaking levels.
The choice of the method used in site response analysis shall be justified considering the expected stress-strain behavior of soils under the shaking level considered in the analysis.
Site-specific site response analysis may be performed using one-dimensional analysis. However, to the extent that MOTs often involve slopes or earth retaining struc�tures, the one-dimensional analysis should be used judi�ciously. When one-dimensional analysis cannot be
justified or is not adequate, two-dimensional equivalent linear or nonlinear response analysis shall be per�formed. Site-specific response analysis results shall be compared to those basedon the simplified method of Sec�tion 3103F.4.2.4 for reasonableness.
For the port areas of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme, the resulting response spectra shall not fall below values obtained in Section 3103F.4.2.3.
The peak ground accelerations obtained from this site-specific evaluation are DPGAs and the spectral accelerations are DSAs as long as the near-fault directivity effects addressed in Section 3103F.4.2. 6 are appropriately incorporated into the time histories (Sec�tion 3103F.4.2.10).
31 03F.4.2.6 Directivity effects. When the site is 15 km (9.3 miles) or closer to a seismic source that can significantly affect the site, near-fault directivity effects shall be reflected in the spectral acceleration values and in the

deterministic spectral acceleration values of Section 3103F.4.2. 7. However, Tables 31F-3-3 and 31F-3-4 for the port areas of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme already have these effects included.
Two methods are available for incorporating directivity effects.
1.
Directivity effects may be reflected in the spectral acceleration values in a deterministic manner by using, for example, the equation on pg. 213 (andTables 6and 7) ofSomerville, et al. [3.9]. The criti�

. cal seismic sources and their characterization devel�oped as part of the deterministic ground motion parameters (Section 3103F.4.2. 7) should be used to evaluate the directivity effects. The resulting adjust�ments in spectral acceleration values may be applied in the probabilistic spectral acceleration values developed per Section 3103F.4.2.4 or 3103F.4.2.5. Such adjustment can be independent of the probabil�ity levels of spectral accelerations.

2.
Directivity effects may be incorporated in the results of site specific PSHA per Section 31 03F.4.2.3. 1n this case, the directivity effects will also depend on the probability level of spectral accelerations.


If spectral accelerations are obtained in this manner, the effects of site amplification using either Section 3103F.4.2.4, 3103F.4.2.5 or an equivalent method (if justified) shall be incorporated.
3103F.4.2. 7 Deterministicearthquake motions.Deter�ministic ground motions from "scenario " earthquakes may be used for comparison purposes. Deterministic peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations may be obtained using the "Critical Seismic Source " with maxi�mum earthquake magnitude and its closest appropriate distance to the MOT. "Critical Seismic Source" is that which results in the largest computed medianpeak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values when appropriate attenuation relationships are used. The val�ues obtained from multiple attenuation relationships should be used to calculate the median peak ground accel�eration and spectral acceleration values.
For comparison, the values of peak ground accelera�tions and spectral accelerations may be obtained from the USGS maps [3. 1], corresponding to the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE). In this case, the median values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceler�ation values shall be 213 (see Subsection 1.6 of�3.1]) of the values shown on the USGS maps.
3103F.4.2.8 Designearthquake magnitude. The design earthquake magnitude used in developing site-specific acceleration time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10) or liq�uefaction assessment (Section 31 06F.3) is obtained using either of the following two methods.
1. The design earthquake may be selected as the larg�est earthquake magnitude associated with the crit�ical seismic source. The distance shall be taken as the closest distance from the source to the site. The resulting design earthquake shall be associated with all DPGA values for the site, irrespective of probability levels.



2. 	The design earthquake (DEQ) may be obtained for
each DPGA or DSA value and associated proba�
bility level by determining the corresponding dom�
inant distance and magnitude. These are the
values of the distance and magnitude that contrib�
ute the most to the mean seismic hazards estimates

for the probability of interest. They are usually determined by locating the summits of the 3-D sur�face of contribution of each small interval of mag�nitude and distance to the total mean hazards estimate. If this 3-D suiface shows several modes with approximate weight of more than 20 percent of the total, several DEQs may be considered, and the DEQ leading to the most conservative design parameters shall be used.



3103F.4.2.9 Designspectral acceleration for various damping values. Design spectral acceleration (DSA) values at damping other than 5 percent shall be obtained by using a procedure given in [3.1], and is denoted as DSAd. The following procedure does not include near-fault directivity effects.
For 0 < T < 0.2 T0

Such a procedure shall incorporate the near-fault

directivity effects when the MOT is 15 km (9.3 miles) or closer to a significant seismic source.

3103F.4.2.10 Development ofacceleration time histories. When acceleration time histories are utilized, target spectral acceleration values shall be initially selected corresponding to the DSA values at appropriate probability levels. For each set of target spectral acceleration values corresponding to one probability level, at least three sets of horizontal time histories (one or two horizontal acceleration time histories per set) shall be developed.

Initial time histories shall consider magnitude, distance and the type of fault that are reasonably similar to those associated with the conditions contributing most to the probabilistic DSA values. Preferred initial time histories should have their earthquake magnitude and distance to the seismic source similar to the mode-magnitude and mode-distance derived from the PSHA or from appropri�ate maps. When an adequate number of recorded time his�tories are not available, acceleration time histories from simulations may be used as supplements.
Scaling or adjustments, either in the frequency domain or in the time domain (preferably), prior to generating acceleration time histories should be kept to a minimum. When the target spectral accelerations include near-fault directivity effects (Section 3103F.4.2.6), the initial time histories should exhibit directivity effects.
When three sets of time histories are used in the analy�sis, the envelope of the spectral acceleration values from each time history shall be equal to or higher than the tar�

() 	get spectral accelerations. If the envelope values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that the spectral acceleration envelope is higher than target spectral accelerations. If the envelope is not higher, thenajustification shall be provided.
When seven or more sets of time histories are used, the average of the spectral acceleration values from the set of time histories shall be equal or higher than the target
spectral acceleration values. If the average values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that average values are higher than the target spectral accelerations. If this is not the case, then an explanation for the use of these particular spectral accel�eration values shall be provided.


When three sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the maximum value of each response parameter shall be used in the design, evaluation and rehabilitation. When seven or more sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the average value of each response parameter may be used.

3103F.5 Mooring loads onvessels.
3103F.5.1 General. Forces acting on a moored vessel may be generated by wind, waves, current, tidal variations, tsuna�mis, seiches and hydrodynamic effects of passing vessels. Forces from wind and current acting directly on the Mar structure (not through the vessel in the form of mooring and/ or breasting loads) shall be determined in Section 3103F.7.

The vessel's moorings shall be strong enough to hold dur�ing all expected conditions of surge, current and weather

MARINE OIL TERMINALS



and long enough to allow adjustment for changes in draft, drift and tide (2 CCR 2340 (c) (1)) [3.10].
3103F.5.2 Wind loads. Wind loads on a vessel, moored at a MOT , shall be determined using procedures described in this section. Wind loads shall be calculated for each of the load cases identified in Section 3105F.2.
3103F.5.2.1 Design wind speed. The design wind speed is the maximum wind speed of 30-second duration used in the mooring analysis (see Section 3105F).
3103F.5.2.1.1 Operating condition. The operating condition is the wind envelope in which a vessel may conduct transfer operations. It is determined from the mooring analysis (Section 3105F). Transfer opera�tions shall cease, at an existing MOT, when the wind exceeds the maximum velocity of the envelope.
3103F.5.2.1.2 Survival condition. The survival con�dition is defined as the state wherein a vessel can remain safely moored at the berth during severe winds. For new MOTs, the survival condition thresh�old is the maximum wind velocity, for a 30-second gust and a 25-year return period, obtained from his�torical data.
For an existing Mar, a reduced survival condition threshold is acceptable (see Figure 31F-2-l). If the wind rises above these levels, the vessel must depart the berth; it shall be able to depart within 30 minutes (see 2 CCR 2340 (c) (28)) [3.10].
The 30-second duration wind speed shall be deter�mined from the annual maximum wind data. Average annual summaries cannot be used. Maximum wind speed data for eight directions ( 45-degree increments) shall be obtained. If other duration wind data is avail�able, it shall be adjusted to a 30-second duration, in accordance with Equation (3.12). The 25-year return period shall be used to establish the design wind speed for each direction. In order to simplify the analysis for < barges (or other small vessels), they may be considered to be solid free-standing walls (Chapter 6 of ASCE 7 [3.11]). This will eliminate the need to perform a com�
puter assisted mooring analysis.
3103F.5.2.2Wind speed corrections. Wind speed mea�sured at an elevation of 33 feet (10 meters) above the water surface, with duration of 30 seconds shall be used to determine the design wind speed. If these conditions are not met, the following corrections shall be applied.
The correction for elevation is obtained from the equation:

(3-11)
where:

Vw =wind speed at elevation 33ft. (10m.)
vh = wind speed at elevation h
h = elevation above water surface of wind data [feet]






The available wind duration shall be adjusted to a 30-second value, using the following formula:
vt=0 sec = v, (3-12)
3c,
where:
V, 30 sec = wind speed for a 30-second duration
=
V, = wind speed over a given duration
c, = conversion factor from Figure 31F-3-3
If wind data is available over land only, the following equation shall be used to convert the wind speed from over-land to over-water conditions [3.10]:
Vw=1.JOVL (3-13)
where:
Vw = over water wind speed
VL = over land wind speed
31 03R5.2.3 Static wind loads on vessels.The "Mooring Equipment Guidelines (MEG3)" [3.13] or the "British Standard Code of Practice for Maritime Structures"
[3.14] shall be used to determine the wind loads for all tank vessels.
Alternatively, wind loads for any type of vessel may be calculated using the guidelines in Ferritto et al, 1999


[3.15].

3103F.5.3 Current loads. Environmental loads induced by
currents at MOTs shall be calculated as specified in this
subsection.

3103R5.3.1 Design current velocity. Maximum ebb and flood currents, annual river runoffs and controlled releases shall be considered when establishing the design current velocities for both existing and new MOTs.
Local current velocities may be obtained from NOAA
[3.16] or other sources, but must be supplemented by site-specific data, if the current velocity is higher than
1.5 knots.
Site-specific data shall be obtained by real time mea�surements over a one-year period. If this information is not available, a safety factor of 1.25 shall be applied to the best available data until real time measurements are obtained.
If the facility is not in operation during annual river runoffs and controlled releases, the current loads may be adjusted.
Operational dates need to be clearly stated in the defi�nition of the terminal operating limits (see Section 3102F.3.6).
3103F.5.3.2 Currentvelocity adjustment factors. An average current velocity (Vc) shall be used to compute forces and moments. lf the current velocity profile is known, the average current velocity can be obtained from the following equation:


T
2

Vc = 1 I TJ (vc )2 ds (3-14)
0


where:
Vc = average current velocity (knots)
(J
T = draft of vessel
v c = current velocity as a function of depth (knots)
s = water depth measured from the suiface

If the velocity profile is not known, the velocity at a
known water depth should be adjusted by the factors pro�

0

vided in Figure 31 F-3-4 to obtain the equivalent average
velocity over the draft of the vessel.

3103R5.3.3Staticcurrentloads. The OC1MF [3. 13],
the British Standard [3.14] or the UFC 4-159-03 [3.17]
procedures shall be used to determine current loads for
moored tank vessels.

3103F.5.3.4Sealevel rise (SLR).All MOTs shall con�
sider the predicted SLR over the remaining life of the ter�
minal, due to subsidence or climate change combined
with maximum high tide and storm surge. Consideration
shall include but not be limited to variation in fender
locations, additional berthing loads (deeper draft ves�

sels) and any components near the splash zone. ()

3103R5.4 Wave loads.When the significant wave period, Ts, is greater than 4 seconds (See Section 3105F.3.1), the trans�verse wave induced vessel reactions shall be calculated using
a simplified dynamic mooring analysis described below.
The horizontal water particle accelerations shall be cal�culated for the various wave conditions, taken at the mid-depth of the loaded vessel draft. The water particle accelerations shall then be used to calculate the wave exci�tation forces to determine the static displacement of the ves�sel. The Froude-Krylov method discussed in Chakrabarti's
Chapter 7 [ 3.18 I may be used to calculate the wave excita�tion forces, by conservatively approximating the vessel as a rectangular box with dimensions similar to the actual dimensions of the vessel. The horizontal water particle accelerations shall be calculated for the various wave con�ditions, taken at the mid-depth of the loaded vessel draft. The computed excitation force assumes a 90-degree inci�dence angle with the longitudinal axis of the vessel, which will result in forces that are significantly greater than the forces that will actually act upon the vessel from quartering \__)
seas. A load reduction factor may be used to account for the design wave incidence angle from the longitudinal axis of the ship. The overall excursion of the vessel shall be deter�mined for each of the wave conditions by calculating the dynamic response of the linear spring mass system.

3103F.5.5 Passing vessels. When required in Section 3105F.3, the sway and surge forces, as well as yaw moment, on a moored vessel, due to passing vessels, shall be estab�lished considering the following:
1.
Ratio of length of moored vessel to length of passing vessel.

2.
Distance from moored vessel to passing vessel.

3.
Ratio of midship section areas of the moored and passing vessels.

4.
Underkeel clearances of the moored and passing ves�sels.

5.
Draft and trim of the moored vessel and draft of the passing vessel.

6.
Mooring line tensions.



The passing vessel's speed should take into consideration the ebb or flood current. Normal operating wind and cur�rent conditions can be assumed when calculating forces due to a passing vessel. Either method ofKrieble [3.19 1 or Wang
[3.20] may be used to determine forces on a moored vessel. Kriebel's recent wave tank study improves on an earlier work of Seelig [3.21].
3103F.5.6 Seiche. The penetration of long period low amplitude waves into a harbor can result in resonant stand�ing wave systems, when the wave forcing frequency coin�cides with a natural frequency of the harbor. The resonant standing waves can result in large surge motions if this fre�quency is close to the natural frequency of the mooring sys�tem. Section 3105F.3.3 prescribes the procedure for the evaluation of these effects.
3103F.5. 7 Tsunamis. A tsunami may be generated by an earthquake or a subsea or coastal landslide, which may induce large wave heights and excessive currents. The large wave or surge and the excessive currents are potentially damaging, especially if there is a tank vessel moored along�side the MOT wharf.
Tsunamis can be generated either by a distant or near source. A tsunami generated by a distant source (far field event) may allow operators to have an adequate warning for mitigating the risk by depart the MOT and go into deep water. For near-field events, with sources less than 500 miles away, the vessel may not have adequate time to depart. Each MOT shall have a "tsunami plan" describing what actions will be performed, in the event of a distant tsunami.
Recent tsunami studies have been completed for both Southern and Northern California. For the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, one of those recent studies
focused on near field tsunamis with predicted return periods of5,000 to 10,000 years [3.221. These maximum water lev�els (run-up) would not normally be used for MOT design. However, because the study also provides actual tidal records from recent distant tsunamis, it should be used for design.
The run-up value for Port Hueneme was obtained from an earlier study by Synolakis et al. [3.231.
Run up-values: PortofLosAngelesandLong Beach= 8ft.
Port Hueneme = 11ft.

For the San Francisco Bay, a recent study provides the maximum credible tsunami water levels and current speeds. These results are deterministic and are based on the most severe seismic sources that could reasonably impact MOTs in the San Francisco Bay [3.241. Table 31F-3-8 provides values for the marine oil terminal locations within San Francisco Bay. Water levels could be positive or negative and current velocities may vary in direction. In order to determine the maximum run-up at a MOT, the largest values should be added to the mean high tide. Further details are available in [3.241.
Loads from tsunami-induced waves can be calculated for various structural configurations [3.25 1. Tsunami wave heights in shallow water and particle kinematics can also be obtained. Other structural considerations include uplift and debris impact.

3103F.6 Berthing Loads.
3103F.6.1 General. Berthing loads are quantified in terms of transfer of kinetic energy of the vessel into potential energy dissipated by the fender( s ). The terms and equations below are based on those in UFC 4-152-01, "Piers and Wharves" [3.261 and PIANC [3.271. <

where:
Evessel =Berthing energy ofvessel [ft-lbs1 W = Total weight of vessel and cargo in pounds [long

MARINE OIL TERMINALS

0 The following correction factors shall be used to modify the actual energy to be absorbed by the fender system for berthing operations:

Efender =FA �Cb �Cm �Evessel 	(3-I6)
where:


Efender =Energy to be absorbed by the fender system
FA = 	Accidental factor accounting for abnormal condi�
tions such as human error, malfunction, adverse environmental conditions or a combination of these factors. For existing berthing systems, FA may be taken as 1.0. For new berthing systems, FA shall be determined in accordance with UFC Sec�tion 4-I52-0I [3.26] or PIANC Section 4.2.8 [3.27].
Cb =Berthing Coefficient

Cm = Effective mass or virtual mass coefficient (see Sec�tion 3103F.6.6)

The berthing coefficient, cb> is given by:
c. =Ce �Cg �Cd �Cc 	(3-I7)
where:

Ce = Eccentricity Coefficient Cc = Configuration Coefficient Cg = Geometric Coefficient () Cd =Deformation Coefficient

These coefficients are defined in Sections 3103F.6.2 through 3I03F.6.5.
The approximate displacement of the vessel (when only partially loaded) at impact, DT, can be determined from an extension of an equation from Gaythwaite [3.28]:
(3-I8)
where:

DWT = Dead Weight Tonnage (in long tons)

0
dacruaz = Actual arrival draft of the vessel dmax = Maximum loaded vessel draft
The berthing load shall be based on the fender reaction
due to the kinetic berthing energy. The structural capacity shall be established based on allowable concrete, steel or timber properties in the structural components, as defined in Section 3I 07F.


3103F.6.2 Eccentricity coefficient (C.). During the berth�ing maneuver, when the vessel is not parallel to the berthing line (usually the wharf face), not all the kinetic energy of the vessel will be transmitted to the fenders. Due to the reaction from the fender( s ), the vessel will start to rotate around the contact point, thus dissipating part of its energy. Treating the vessel as a rigid rod of negligible width in the analysis of
.(
' the energy impact on the fenders leads to the equation:
e
ce = 	(3-I9)
2 +k2a

where:

k = Longitudinal radius of gyration of the vessel [ft]
a =Distance between the vessel's center of gravity and the point of contact on the vessel's side, pro�jected onto the vessel's longitudinal axis [ft]
3103F.6.3
Geometric coefficient (CJ.
The geometric coef
ficient, ell' depends upon the geometric configuration of the ship at the point ofimpact. Itvariesfrom 0. 85 for an increas�ing convex curvature to I.25 for concave curvature. Gener�
ally, 0.95 is recommended for the impact point at or beyond the quarter points of the ship, and I.O for broadside berth�ing in which contact is made along the straight side [ 3.26].
3103F.6.4Deformation coefficient (CJ. This accounts for the energy reduction effects dite to local deformation of the ships hull and deflection of the whole ship along its longitudinal axis. The energy absorbed by the ship depends on the relative stiffness of the ship and the obstruction. The deformation coef�ficient varies from 0.9 for a nonresilient fender to nearly I.O for a flexible fender. For larger ships on energy-absorbing fender systems, little or no deformation of the ship takes place; there�fore, a coefficient of 1.0 is recommended.
3103F.6.5 Configuration coefficient (Ce). This factor accounts for the difference between an open pier or wharf and a solid pier or wharf. In the first case, the movements of the water surrounding the berthing vessel is not (or is hardly) affected by the berth. In the second case, the water between the berthing vessel and the structure introduces a cushion effect that represents an extra force on the vessel away from the berth and reduces the energy to be absorbed by the fender system.
For open berth and corners of solid piers, Cc = I.O
For solid piers with parallel approach, Cc = 0.8

For berths with different conditions, Cc may be interpo�lated between these values [3.26].
3103F.6.6 Effective mass or virtual mass coefficient (CmJ.
In determining the kinetic energy of a berthing vessel, the effective or the virtual mass is the sum of vessel mass and hydrodynamic mass. The hydrodynamic mass does not nec�essarily vary with the mass of the vessel, but is closely related to the projected area of the vessel at right angles to the direction of motion.
Other factors, such as the form of vessel, water depth, berthing velocity, and acceleration or deceleration of the vessel, will have some effect on the hydrodynamic mass. Taking into account both model and prototype experiments, the effective or virtual mass coefficient can be estimated as:
actual

where:

dacrual = Actual arrival draft of the vessel B = Beam of vessel The value of Cmfor use in design should be a minimum of

I.5 and need not exceed 2.0 [3.26].

2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE


3103F.6.7 Berthing velocity and angle. The berthing veloc�ity, V, is influenced by a large number of factors such as envi�ronmental conditions of the site (wind, current and wave), method ofberthing (with or without tugboat assistance), con�dition of the vessel during berthing (ballast or fully laden) and human factors (experience of the tugboat captain).
The berthing velocity, normal to berth, shall be in accor�

> dance with Table 31 F-3-9. Site condition is determined from
> Table 31F-3-10.
Subject to Division approval, if an existing MOT can dem�onstrate lower velocities by utilizing velocity monitoring equipment, then such a velocity may be used temporarily until the berthing system is compliant with this Code.

In order to obtain the normal berthing velocity, V, an approach angle, defined as the angle formed by the fender line and the longitudinal axis of the vessel must be determined. The berthing angles, used to compute the normal berthing velocity,
Jot various vessel sizes are shown in Table 31F-3-ll.

3103F. 7 Wind and current loads onstructures.
31 03F. 7.1 GeneraLThis section provides methods to deter�mine the wind and current loads acting on the structure directly, as opposed to wind and current forces acting on the structure from a moored vessel.

3103F.7.2 Wind loads. Chapter 6 of ASCE 7[3. 11] shall be used to establish minimum wind loads on the structure. Additional information about wind loads may be obtained from Simiu and Scanlan [3.29].
3103F. 7.3 Current loads. The current forces acting on the structure may be established using the current velocities, per Section 3103F.5.3.
3103F.8Load combinations. As a minimum, each component of the structure shall be analyzed for all applicable load combi�nations given in Table 31F-3-12 or 31F-3-13, depending on component type. For additional load combinations see "Piers and Wharves," DOD UFC4-152-01 [3.26].
The "vacant condition" is the case wherein there is no vessel at the berth. The �mooring and breasting condition " exists after the vessel is securely tied to the whaif. The "berthing condition " occurs as the vessel impacts the whaif, and the "earthquake condition" assumes no vessel is at the berth, and there is no wind or current forces on the structure.
The use of various load types is discussed below:
31 03F.8.1 Dead load (D). Upper and lower bound values of dead load are applied for the vacant condition to check the maximum moment and shear with minimum axial load.
3103F.8.2 Live load (L). The live load on MOTs is typically small and is therefore neglected for combinations including earthquake loads.
3103F.8.3 Buoyancyload(B). Buoyancy forces shall be considered for any submerged or immersed substructures (including pipelines, sumps and structural components).
3103F.8.4 Wind (W) and current (C) on the structure. Wind and currents on the vessel are included in the mooring and

breasting condition. The wind and current loads acting on the structure are therefore additional loads that can act simulta�neously with the mooring, breasting and/or berthing loads.
3103F.8.5 Earth pressure on the structure (H). The soil pressure on end walls, typically concrete cut-off walls, steel sheet pile walls on wharf type structures and/or piles shall be considered.
3103F.8.6 Mooring linelbreasting loads (M). Mooring line and breasting loads can occur simultaneously or individu�ally, depending on the combination of wind and current. Multiple load cases for operating and survival conditions may be required (see Sections 3103F.5.2 and 3105F.2). In addition, loads caused by passing vessels shall be consid�ered for the "mooring and breasting condition." Refer to Sections 3105F.2 and 3/05F.3 for the determination of mooring line and breasting loads.
3103F.8. 7 Berthing load (B.). Berthing is afrequent occur�rence, and shall be considered as a normal operating load. No increase in allowable stresses shall be applied for ASD.

SECTION 3104F
SEISMIC ANALYSIS
AND STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE

3104F.l General.
3104F.I.l Purpose. The purpose of this section is to estab�lish minimum standards for seismic analysis and structural performance. Seismic performance is evaluated at two cri�teria levels. Level l requirements define a performance cri�terion to ensure MOT functionality. Level 2 requirements safeguard against major structural damage or collapse.
3104F.I.2 Applicability. Section 3104F applies to all new and existing MOTs structures. Structures supporting load�ing arms, pipelines, oil transfer and storage equipment, critical nonstructural systems and vessel mooring struc�tures, such as mooring and breasting dolphins are included. Catwalks and similar components that are not part of the lateral load carrying system and do not support oil transfer equipment may be excluded.
3104F.I.3 Oil spill risk classification. Each existing MOT shall be catagorized into one of three risk classifications (high, medium or low) as shown in Table 31F-4-l, based on the highest of the following:
1. 	Exposed total volume of oil during transfer ("total volume" as calculated in Section 3108F.2.3)

2, 	Number of oil transfer operations per berthing system per year
3. Maximum vessel size (DWT) that may call at the berthing system
If risk reduction strategies (see Section 3101 F.5) are adopted such that the maximum volume of exposed oil dur�ing transfer is less than 1,200 barrels, the classification level of the facility may be lowered. All new MOTs are clas�sified as high risk.
3104F.1.4 Configuration classification. Each MOT shall be designated as regular or irregular, in accordance with Figure 31F-4-1.
Irregular configurations, such as the "T" layout, may be analyzed as regular if the presence of expansion joints divides the T-configuration into two or more regular segments. Expansion joints in this context are defined as joints that sep�arate each structural segment in such a manner that each seg�ment will move independently during an earthquake.
If an irregular MOT is divided into seismically isolated sections, an evaluation of the relative movement of pipelines






PIER AND WHARF CONFIGURATIONS

and supports shall be considered, including phase differ�ences (Section 3109F.3).
3104F.2 Existing MOTs
3104F.2.1 Design earthquake motions. Two levels of design seismic performance shall be considered. These lev�els are defined as follows:
Level l Seismic performance:
�
Minor or no structural damage

�
Temporary or no interruption in operations


Level 2 Seismic performance:

�
Controlled inelastic structural behavior with repairable damage

�
Prevention of structural collapse


�
Temporary loss of operations, restorable within months


�
Prevention of major spill (  1200 bbls)

31 04F.2.2 Basis for evaluation. Component capacities shall be based on existing conditions, calculated as "best esti�mates," taking into account the mean material strengths, strain hardening and degradation overtime. The capacity of components with little or no ductility, which may lead to brit�tle failure scenarios, shall be calculated based on lower bound material strengths. Methods to establish component strength and deformation capacities for typical structural

materials and components are provided in Section 3107F. Geotechnical considerations are discussed in Section 31 06F.
31 04F.2.3 Analytical procedures. The objective of the seis�mic analysis is to verify that the displacement capacity of the structure is greater than the displacement demand, for each peiformance level defined in Table 31F-4-2. The required analytical procedures are summarized in Table 3JF-4-3.
The displacement capacity of the structure shall be calcu�lated using the nonlinear static (pushover) procedure. It is also acceptable to use a nonlinear dynamic procedure for capacity evaluation. Methods used to calculate the dis�placement demand are linear modal, nonlinear static and nonlinear dynamic.
II Any rational method, subject to the Division 's approval, can be used in lieu of the required analytical procedures shown in Table 31F-4-3.
31 04F.2.3.1 Nonlinear static capacity procedure (push�over). Two-dimensional nonlinear static (pushover) analyses shall be performed; three-dimensional analy�ses are optional. A model that incorporates the nonlinear load deformation characteristics of all components for the lateral force-resisting system shall be displaced to a target displacement to determine the internal deforma�behavior may be lumped in fewer larger springs, pro�vided that the overall torsional effects are captured.

Linear material component behavior is acceptable where nonlinear response will not occur. All compo�nents shall be based on effective moment of inertia calculated in accordance with Section 31 07F. Spe�
cific requirements for timber pile structures are dis�cussed in the next section.

3104F.2.3.1.2 Timber pile supported structures. For all timber pile supported structures, linear elastic procedures may be used. Alternatively, the nonlinear static procedure may be used to estimate the target displacement demand, 11,r
A simplified single pile model for a typical timber pile supported structure is shown in Figure 3JF-4-2. The pile-deck connections may be assumed to be "pinned." The lateral bracing can often be ignored if it is in poor condition. These assumptions shall be used for the anal�ysis, unless a detailed condition assessment and lateral analysis indicate that the existing bracing and connec�tions may provide reliable lateral resistance.

tions and forces. The target displacement depends on the
seismic peiformance level under consideration. Model�
ing details are as follows:
3104F.2.3.1.1 Modeling. A series of nonlinear push�over analyses may be required depending on the com�plexity of the MOT structure. At a minimum, pushover analysis of a two-dimensional model shall be con�ducted in both the longitudinal and transverse direc�tions. The piles shall be represented by nonlinear elements that capture the moment-curvature/rotation







relationships for components with expected inelastic behavior in accordance with Section 31 07F. A nonlin�ear element is not required to represent each pile FIGURE 31 F-4-2-51MPLIFIED SINGLE PILE MODEL OF A location. Piles with similar lateral force-deflection TIMBER PILE SUPPORTED STRUCTURE

A series of single pile analyses may be sufficient to establish the nonlinear springs required for the push�over analysis.
3104F.2.3.1.3 Soil-structure interaction (SSI).
Load-deformation characteristics for foundations shall be modeled as per Section 31 06F. 5. Selection of soil springs shall be based on the following:


I. Effect of the large difference in up and down slope stiffnesses for wharf type structures
2. Effect of upper and lower bound soil parame�ters, especially for t-z curves used to model bat�ter pile behavior

A separate analysis that captures the demand (Section () 3104F.2.3.2) on the piles due to permanent ground deformations, at embanlanents only, shall be performed.
If a simplified methodology is followed, the piles need to be checked for the following load combinations:

tures, with the exception of irregular configurations with high or moderate seismic risk classifications. The fol�lowing Sections (3104F.2.3.2.1 through 3104F.2.3.4) describe the procedure of Priestly et al. [4.1]; an alter�nate procedure is presented in ATC 40 [4.2], which is improved in FEMA 440 [ 4.3 ]. A linear modal procedure is required for irregular structures with high or moderate seismic risk classifications, and may be used for all other classifications in lieu of the nonlinear static procedure. 3104F.2.3.2.1 Lateral stiffness. The lateral stiffness, k, is calculated from the force-displacement relation as the total base shear, VY' corresponding to the yield dis�placement of the structure a,. /).y is the displacement at first yield in the pile/deck connection reinforcement. 3104F.2.3.2.2 Structural period.

3104F.2.3.2.4 Damping. The displacement demand established in Section 3104F.2.3.2.3 is based on 5 percent damping. Higher damping values obtained from a refined analysis may be used to calculate the displacement demand.
3104F.2.3.2.5 Refined analyses. Refined displacement demand analyses may be calculated as per Chapters 4 and 5 of [4.1] and is briefly summarized below.

3104F.2.3.3 Linear modal demandprocedure. For irregular concrete/steel structures with moderate or high risk classifications, a linear analysis is required to pre�dict the global displacement demands. A 3-D linear elas�tic response analysis shall be used, with effective moment of inertia applied to components to establish lateral dis�placement demands.


Sufficient modes shall be included in the analysis such that 90 percent of the participating mass is captured in each of the principal horizontal directions for the struc�ture. For modal combinations, the complete quadratic combination rule shall be used. Multidirectional excita�tion shall be accounted for in accordance with Section 3104F.4.2.
The lateral stiffness of the linear elastic response model shall be based on the initial stiffness of the nonlin�ear pushover curve as shown in Figure 31 F-4-6 (also see Section 3106F.5.1). The p-y springs shall be adjusted based on the secant method approach. Most of the p-y springs will typically be based on their initial stiffness; no iteration is required.


If the fundamental period in the direction under con�sideration is less than T0, as defined in Section 3104F.2.3.2.3, then the displacement demand shall be amplified as specified in Section 3104F.2.3.2.5.











3104F.2.3.4 Nonlinear dynamic analysis. Nonlinear dynamic time history analysis is optional, and if per�formed, a peer review is required (see Section 310JF.6. 1 ). Multiple acceleration records shall be used, as explained in Section 3103F.4.2.10. The following assumptions may be made:
1.
Equivalent "super piles" can represent groups of piles.

2.
If the deck has sufficient rigidity (both in-plane and out-of plane) to just{fy its approximation as a rigid element, a 2-D plan simulation may be ade�quate.


A time-history analysis should always be compared with a simplified approach to ensure that results are rea�sonable. Displacements calculated from the nonlinear time history analyses may be used directly in design, but shall not be less than 80 percent of the values obtained
from Section 3104F.2.3.2.
3104F.2.3.5 Alternative procedures. Alternative lat�eral-force procedures using rational analyses based on well-established principles of mechanics may be used in lieu of those prescribed in these provisions. As per Sec�tion 3101F.6.1, peer review is required.
3104F.3 New MOTs. The analysis and design requirements described in Section 3104F.2 shall also apply to new MOTs. Additional requirements are as follows:
1.
Site-specific response spectra analysis (see Section 3103F.4.2.3).

2.
Soil parameters based on site-specific and new borings (see Section 3106F.2.2).


3104F.4 General analysis and design requirements.
3104F.4.1 Load combinations. Earthquake loads shall be used in the load combinations described in Section 3 103F.8. 3104F.4.2 Combination of orthogonal effects. The design
displacement demand, Aw shall be calculated by combining the longitudinal, A:v and transverse, A,. displacements in the horizontal plane (Figure 31 F-4-7): �

whichever results in the greater design displacement demand.
In lieu of combining the displacement demands as pre�sented above, the design displacement demand for marginal wharf type MOTs may be calculated as: (4-12)

where:

A.v = transverse displacement demand e = eccentricity between center of mass and center of rigidity L1 = longitudinal length between wharf expansion
This equation is only valid for wharf aspect ratios (length/ breadth) greater than 3.
3104F.4.3 P-A Effects. The P-A effect (i.e., the additional moment induced by the total vertical load multiplied by the lateral deck deflection) shall be considered unless the fol�lowing relationship is satisfied (see Figure 31F-4-8):

where:


V 	= base shear strength of the structure obtained from

limited by almost
fully embedded piles, P-A effects may be ignored; however, the individual stability of the piles shall be checked in accordance with Section 3107F.2.5.2.

31 04F.4.4 Expansion joints. The effect of expansion joints shall be considered in the seismic analysis.
3104F.4.5 Shear key forces. Shear force across shear keys
connecting adjacent wharf segments,
vsk� (approximate upper bound to the shear key force [ 4.4]) shall be calculated as follows:
v,k = 15(ejL1 )VAT (4-I4)

where:
VAT = total segment lateral force found from a push-over
analysis
L1 segment length

e = eccentricity between the center of rigidity and the center of mass

3104F.4.6 Connections. For an existing wharf, the deterio�rated conditions at the junction between the pile top and pile cap shall be considered in evaluating the moment capacity. Connection detail between the vertical pile and pile cap shall be evaluated to determine whether full or partial moment capacity can be developed under seismic action.
For new MOTs, the connection details shall develop the full moment capacities.
The modeling shall simulate the actual moment capacity (full or partial) of the joint in accordance with Section 3107F.2. 7.
3104F.4. 7 Batter piles. Batter piles primarily respond to earthquakes by developing large axial compression or ten�sion forces. Bending moments are generally of secondary importance. Failure in compression may be dictated by the deck-pile connection (most common type), material com�pression, buckling, or by excessive local shear in deck mem�bers adjacent to the batter pile. Failure in tension may be dictated by connection strength or by pile pull out. (p. 3-83 of{4.4]).
When the controlling failure scenario is reached and the batter pile fails, the computer model shall be adjusted to consist of only the vertical pile acting either as a full or par�tial moment frame based on the connection details between the pile top and pile cap. The remaining displacement capacity, involving vertical piles, before the secondary fail�ure stage develops, shall then be established (see Section 3107F.2.8).
Axial p-z curves shall be modeled. In compression, dis�placement capacity should consider the effect of the reduc�tion in pile modulus of elasticity at high loads and the increase in effective length for friction piles. This proce�dure allows the pile to deform axially before reaching ulti�mate loads, thereby increasing the displacement ductility [4.4].
Horizontal nonlinear p-y springs are only applied to bat�ter piles with significant embedment, such as for landside batter piles in a wharf structure. Moment fixity can be assumed for batter piles that extend well above the ground
such as waterside batter piles in a wharf structure or batter piles in a pier type structure.
3104F.5 Nonstructural components. This section covers nonstructural components having a significant mass and/or a critical importance to the operability and safety of the MOT. The weight of nonstructural components shall be included in the dead load of the structure, per Section 3I03F.2.
3104F.5.1 Contribution to global response. Nonstructural components including, but not limited to pipelines, loading arms, raised platforms, control rooms and vapor control equipment, may affect the global structural response. In such cases, the seismic characteristics (mass and/or stiffness) of the nonstructural components shall be considered. Ifthe seis�mic response of nonstructural components is out of phase with the global structural response, then the mass contribu�tion can be neglected in the seismic structural analysis.
3104F.5.2 Seismic loads. In general, for nonstructural components, the evaluation procedures of Section 3IJOF.8 are adequate.
For pipelines, the seismic analysis shall be performed in accordance with Section 3109F.3, in lieu of Section 3IJOF.8. /f a pipeline analysis has been performed and sup-II port reactions are available, they may be used to determine the forces on the support structure.
A pipeline segment under consideration shall extend between two adjacent anchor points. A simplified pipeline analysis may be used when the relative displacement demands of anchor points are considered. As an option, a
full nonlinear time-history analysis can be used to capture the nonlinear interaction between the structure and the pipeline.
3104F.5.3 Nonstructural critical systems assessment. A seismic assessment of the survivability and continued oper�ation during a Levell earthquake (see Table 3I F -4-2) shall be performed for critical systems. such as fire protection, emergency shutdown and electrical power systems. The assessment shall consider the adequacy and condition of anchorage, flexibility and seismically-induced interaction. For existing systems, seismic adequacy may be assessed per [4.5].

SECTION 3105F MOORING AND BERTHING ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
3105F.l General.
31 OSF.l.l Purpose.This section establishes minimum stan�dards for safe mooring and berthing of vessels at MOTs.
3105F.1.2 Applicability. This section applies to onshore MOTs; Figure31F-5-1 showstypicalpierandwhaifconfig�urations.

FIGURE 31F-5-1 TYPICAL PIER AND WHARF CONFIGURATIONS

>II 	3105F.I.3 Mooring/berthing requirements. Multiple berth MOTs shall use the same conditions for each berth unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant differences.
> 	MOTs shall have the following equipment in operation:
1.
An anemometer (NIE).


2.
A current meter in high velocity current (> 1.5 knots) > areas (NIE).

3.
Remote reading tension load devices in high velocity current (> 1.5 knots) areas and/or with passing vessel effects for new MOTs.

4.
Mooring hardware in 	accordance with Section 3103F.10 (N/E).



Berthing systems shall be in accordance with Section 3105F.4 (N/E).

>

3105F.1.4 New MOTs. Quick release hooks are required at all new MOTs, except for spring line fittings. Quick release hooks shall be sized in accordance with Section 31 03F.JO. To avoid accidental release, the freeing mechanism shall be acti�vated by a two-step process. Quick release hooks shall be
II
II insulated electrically from the mooring structure, and shall be supported so as not to contact the deck.
Section 31 05F.5 and the OCIMF guidelines [ 5.4] shall be
used in designing the mooring layout.
3105F.1.5 Analysis and design of mooring components.
The existing condition of the MOT shall be used in the moor�ing analysis (see Section 31 02F ). Structural characteristics

512
of the MOT, including type and configuration of mooring
fittings such as bollards, bitts, hooks and capstans and
material properties and condition, shall be determined in
accordance with Sections 3107F.4 and 3103F.IO.

The analysis and design of mooring components shall be
based on the loading combinations and safety factors
defined in Sections 3103F.8 through 3103F.JO, and in
accordance with ACI 318 [5.1], AJSC [5.2] and
ANSIIAF&PA NDS [5.3], as applicable.


3105F.2 Mooring analyses. A mooring analysis shall be per�formed for each berthing system, to justify the safe berthing of the various deadweight capacities of vessels expected at the MOT. The forces acting on a moored vessel shall be determined in accordance with Section 31 03F.5. Mooring line and breasting load combinations shall be in accordance with Section 31 03F. 8.


Two procedures, manual and numerical are available for peiforming mooring analyses. These procedures shall conform to either the OCIMF document, "Mooring Equipment Guide�lines (MEG3)" [5.4] or the Department of Defense "Moor�ings" document [5.5]. The manual procedure (Section 3105F.2.1) may be used for barges.
A new mooring assessment shall be peiformed when condi�tions change, such as any modification in the mooring configu�ration, vessel size or new information indicating greater wind, current or other environmental loads.
()

In general, vessels shall remain in contact with the breasting or fendering system. ssel motion (sway) of up to 2 feet off the breasting structure may be allowed under the most severe envi�ronmental loads, unless greater movement can be justified by an appropriate mooring analysis that accounts for potential dynamic effects. The allowable movement shall be consistent with mooring analysis results, indicating that forces in the moor�ing lines and their supports are within the allowable safety fac�tors. Also, a check shall be made as to whether the movement is within the limitations of the cargo transfer equipment.
The most severe combination of the environmental loads has to be identified for each mooring component. At a minimum, the following conditions shall be considered:
1.
Two current directions (maximum ebb and flood; See
Section 3103F.5.3)


2.
Two tide levels (highest high and lowest low)

3.
Two vessel loading conditions (ballast and maximum
draft at the terminal)


4.
Eight wind directions (45 degree increments)




3105F.2.1 Manual procedure. Simplified calculations may
be used to determine the mooring forces for barges with
Favorable site conditions (see Table 31F-3-10) and no
passing vessel effects (see Section 3105R3.2), except if any
of the following conditions exist (Figures 31F-5-2 and
31F-5-3, below).



1.
Mooring layout is significantly asymmetrical

2.
Horizontal mooring line angles (a) on bow and stem exceed 45 degrees

Horizontal breast mooring line angles exceed 15 nor�mal to the hull

4.
Horizontal spring mooring line angles exceed 10 degrees from a line parallel to the hull

sis (See Section 3103F.5.4) is required. The wave period shall be established based on a ]-year significant wave height, H.r For MOTs within a harbor basin, the wave period shall be based on the locally generated waves with relatively short fetch.
3105F.3.2 Passing vessels. These forces generated by pass�ing vessels are due to pressure gradients associated with the flow pattern. These pressure gradients cause the moored vessel to sway, surge, and yaw, thus imposing forces on the mooring lines.
Passing vessel analysis shall be conducted when all of the following conditions exist (See Figure 31F-5-4):
1.
Passing vessel size is greater than 25,000 DWT. II

2.
Distance L is 500 feet or less

3.
Vessel speed Vis greater than Vcrir




where:

considered.

LandB are shown in Figure 3JF-5-4, in units of feet. Vis defined as the speed of vessel over land minus the current velocity, when traveling with the current, or the speed of vessel over land plus the current velocity, when traveling against the current.



and stern
When the forces have been determined and the distance between the bow and stern mooring points is known, the yaw moment can be resolved into lateral loads at the bow and stern. The total environmental loads on a moored vessel are comprised of the lateral load at the vessel bow, the lat�eral load at the vessel stern and the longitudinal load. Line pretension loads must be added.
Four load cases shall be considered:
1.
Entire load is taken by mooring lines

2.
Entire load is taken by breasting structures

3.
Load is taken by combination of mooring lines and breasting structures




FIGURE 31 F-5-4


4. Longitudinal load is taken only by spring lines
3105F.2.2 Numerical procedure. A numerical procedure is required to obtain mooring forces for MOTs that cannot use manual procedure. Computer program(s) shall be based on mooring analysis procedures that consider the characteris�tics of the mooring system, calculate the environmental loads and provide resulting mooring line forces and vessel motions (surge and sway).
3105F.3 Wave, passing vessel, seiche and tsunami.
3105F.3.1 Wind waves. MOTs are generally located in shel�tered waters such that typical wind waves can be assumed not to affect the moored vessel if the significant wave period, T., is less than 4 seconds. However, if the period is equal to or greater than 4 seconds, then a simplified dynamic analy-
PASSING VESSEL

When such conditions (1, 2 and 3 above) exist, the surge and sway forces and the yaw moment acting on the moored vessel shall, as a minimum, be established in accordance with Section 3103F.5.5 or by dynamic analysis.
For MOTs located in ports, the passing distance, L, may be established based on channel width and vessel traffic patterns. The guidelines established in the Department of Defense, UFC 4-150-06, Figure 5-17 [5.6] for interior channels may be used. The "vertical bank" in Figure 5-17 of [5.6] shall be replaced by the side of the moored vessel when establishing the distance, "L ."


BUFF

For Mars, not located within a port, the distance, "L,
" must be determined from observed traffic patterns.
The following passing vessel positions shall be investi�gated:
I. 	Passing vessel is centered on the moored ship. This position produces maximum sway force.
2. 	The midship of the passing vessel is fore or aft of the centerline of the moored ship by a distance of 0.40 times the length of the moored ship. This position is assumed to produce maximum surge force and yaw moment at the same time.

The mooring loads due to a passing vessel shall be added to the mooring loads due to wind and current.
3105F.3.3 Seiche. A seiche analysis is required for existing MOTs located within a harbor basin and which have histor�ically experienced seiche. A seiche analysis is required for new Mars inside a harbor basin prone to penetration of ocean waves.
The standing wave system or seiche is characterized by a series of "nodes " and "antinodes." Seiche typically has wave periods ranging from 20 seconds up to several hours, with wave heights in the range of0.1 to 0.4 ft [5.6].
The following procedure may be used, as a minimum, in evaluating the effects of seiche within a harbor basin. In more complex cases where the assumptions below are not applicable, dynamic methods are required.
1.
Calculate the natural period of oscillation of the basin. The basin may be idealized as rectangular, closed or open at the seaward end. Use Chapter 2 of UFC 4-150-06 [5.6] to calculate the wave period and length for different modes. The first three modes shall be considered in the analysis.

2.
Determine the location of the moored ship with respect to the antinode and node of the first three modes to determine the possibility of resonance.

3.
Determine the natural period of the vessel and moor�ing system. The calculation shall be based on the total mass of the system and the stiffness of the mooring lines in surge. The surge motion of the moored vessel is estimated by analyzing the vessel motion as a har�monically forced linear single degree of freedom spring mass system. Methods outlined in a paper by



F.A. Kilner [5. 7] can be used to calculate the vessel motion.
4. 	Vessels are generally berthed parallel to the chan�nel; therefore, only longitudinal (surge) motions shall be considered, with the associated mooring loads in the spring lines. The loads on the mooring lines (spring lines) are then determined from the computed vessel motion and the stiffness of those mooring lines.

3105F.3.4 Tsunami. Run-up and current velocity shall be considered in the tsunami assessment. Table 31F-3-8 pro�vides run-up values for the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbors and Port Hueneme.





3105F.4 Berthing analysis and design. The analysis and design of berthing components shall be based on the loading combinations and safety factors defined in Sections 3103F.8 and 3103F.9 and in accordance with ACI 318 [5.1], AISC [5.2], and ANSI/AF&PA NDS [5.3], as applicable.
3105F.4.1 Berthing energy demand. The kinetic berthing energy demand shall be determined in accordance with Sec�tion 3103F.6.
3105F.4.2 Berthing energy capacity. For existing MOTs, the berthing energy capacity shall be calculated as the area under the force-deflection curve for the combined structure and fender system as indicated in Figure 31F-5-5. Fender piles may be included in the lateral analysis to establish the total force-deflection curve for the berthing system. Load�deflection curves for other fender types shall be obtained from manufacturer 's data. The condition offenders shall be taken into account when performing the analysis.
When batter piles are present, the fender system typically absorbs most of the berthing energy. This can be established by comparing the force-deflection curves for the fender sys�tem and batter piles. In this case only the fender system energy absorption shall be considered.





FIGURE 31 F-5-5 BERTHING ENERGY CAPACITY

3105F.4.3 Tanker contact length.

3105F.4.3.1 Continuous fender system. A continuous fender system consists of fender piles, chocks, wales, and rubber or spring fender units.
The contact length of a ship during berthing depends on the spacing of the fender piles and fender units, and the connection details of the chocks and wales to the
fender piles.
The contact length, Lc can be approximated by the
chord formed by the curvature of the bow and the berth�ing angle as shown in Equation 5-2 below.

where:
Lc = contact length
r = Bow radius
a = Berthing angle


In lieu of detailed analysis to determine the contact length, Table 31F-5-1 may be used. The contact length

for a vessel within the range listed in the table can be obtained by interpolation.

CONTACT LENGTH




3105R4.3.2 Discrete fender system. For discrete fender systems (i.e., not continuous), one fender unit or breast�ing dolphin shall be able to absorb the entire berthing energy.
3105R4.4 Longitudinal and vertical berthing forces.
The longitudinal and vertical components of the hori�zontal berthing force shall be calculated using appropri�ate coefficients of friction between the vessel and the fender. In lieu of as-built data, the values in Table 31 F-5-2 may be used for typical fender/vessel materials:
II
TABLE 31 F-5-2
COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION


CONTACT MATERIALS  FRICTION COEFFICIENT
Timber to Steel  0.4 to 0. 6
Urethane to Steel  0.4 to 0. 6
Steel to Steel  0.25
Rubber to Steel  0. 6 to 0. 7
UHMW* to Steel  0. 1 to 0.2

*Ultra-high molecular weight plastic rubbing strips.
Longitudinal and vertical forces shall be determined by:
F= !JN 	(5-3)
where:
F = 	longitudinal or vertical component of horizon�tal berthing force
1J = coefficient of friction of contact materials N = maximum horizontal berthing force (normal to fender)
31 05R4.5 Design and selection of new fender systems. For guidelines on new fender designs, refer to the Department of Defense "Piers and Wharves " document (UFC 4-152-01)
[5.8] and the PIANC Guidelines for the Design of Fenders Systems: 2002 [5.9]. Also see Section 3103F.6.
3105R5 Layout of new MOTs. The number and spacing of independent mooring dolphins and breasting dolphins depends on the DWT and length overall (LOA) of vessels to be accommodated.
Breasting dolphins shall be positioned adjacent to the paral�lel body of the vessel when berthed. A minimum of two breast�ing dolphins shall be provided. The spacing of breasting dolphins shall be adequate for all sizes of vessels that may berth at the MOT.




MARINE OIL TERMINALS
Mooring dolphins shall be set back from the berthing line (fender line) for a distance between 115ft and 165ft, so that longer bow, stem and breast lines can be deployed.
For a preliminary layout, the guidelines in the British Stan�dards, Part 4, Section 2 [ 5. 10 }, may be used in conjunction with the guidelines below.
1.
are provided, the spacing between exterior breasting dolphins shall be between 0.3 and 0.4 LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT. The spacing between interior breasting dolphins shall be approximately 0.3 to 0.4LOA of the minimum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT.


2.
If only are provided, the spacing between the dolphins shall be the smaller (0.3LOA) of the guidelines specified above.


3. If bow and stern lines are used for mooring, the spacing between be 1.35 times the LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT.


4. 	The spacing between
shall be
0.8 times the LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT.
The final layout of the mooring and breasting dolphins shall be determined based on the results of the mooring analysis that provides optimal mooring line and breasting forces for the range of vessels to be accommodated. The breasting force under the mooring condition shall not exceed the maximum fender reaction of the fender unit when it is being compressed at the manufacturers rated deflection.

SECTION 3106F GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS AND FOUNDATIONS
3106F.l General.

0
3106F.l.l Purpose. This section provides minimum stan�dards for analyses and evaluation of geotechnical hazards
and foundations.
3106F.l.2 Applicability. The requirements provided herein apply to all new and existing MOTs.

0
3106F.1.3 Seismic loading. The seismic loading for geotechnical hazard assessment and foundation analyses is provided in Section 3103F.4.
3106F.2 Site characterization.
3106F.2.1 Site classes. Each MOT shall be assigned at least one site class, based on site-specific geotechnical informa�tion. Site Classes SA, SB, S0 SD, and SE are defined in Table 31F-6-1 and Site Class SF is defined as follows:

1.
Soils vulnerable to significant potential loss of stiff�ness, strength, and/or volume under seismic loading, such as liquefiable soils, quick and highly sensitive clays, and collapsible weakly cemented soils.

2.
Peats and/or highly organic clays, where the thick�ness of peat or highly organic clay exceeds 10 feet.



3.
Very high plasticity clays with a plasticity index (PI) greater than 75, where depth of clay exceeds 25feet.

4.
Very thick soft/medium stiff clays, where the depth of clay exceeds 120 feet.



3106F.2.2 Site-specific information. In general, geotechni�cal characterization shall be based on site-specific informa�tion. This information may be obtained from existing or new sources. However, if existing or nonsite specific information is used, the geotechnical engineer of record shall provide adequate justification for its use.
Site-specific investigations shall include, at a minimum, bor�

ings and/or cone penetration tests, soil classifications, cmifig�
uration, foundation loading and an assessment of seismic



hazards. The array (number and depths) of exploratory borings and cone penetration tests (CPT) will depend on the proposed or existing structures and site stratigraphy. The investigation or testing activities shall be completed following the procedures in Section 5 ofSCEC [6.3 ]. CPT data may also be used by first converting to standard penetration test (SPT) data, using an appropriate method, that reflects the effects of soil gradation. If geotechnical data other than SPT and CPT are used, an adequate explanation andrationale shall be provided.
Quantitative soil information is required to a depth of 100 feet below the mudline, for assigning a Site Class (see Table 31 F-6-1 ). When data to a depth of 100 feet is unavailable, other information such as geologic considerations may be used to determine the Site Class.
3106F.3 Liquefaction. A liquefaction asse$sment shall
address triggering and the resulting hazards, using residual
shear strengths of liquefied soils.
3106F.3.1 Triggering assessment. Liquefaction triggering shall be expressed in terms of the factor of safety (SF):
SF =CRRjCSR (6-1)
where:

CRR = Cyclic Resistance Ratio CSR = The Cyclic Stress Ratio induced by Design Peak Ground Acceleration (DPGA) or other postu�lated shaking
The CRR shall be determined from Figure 7.1 in SCEC
[6.3 ]. If available, both the SPT and CPT data can be used.


CSR shall be evaluated using the simplified procedure in Section 3106F.3.1.1 or site-specific response analysis pro�cedures in Section 3106F.3.1.2.
Shaking-induced shear strength reductions in liquefiable materials are determined as follows:
1. SF> 1.4

Reductions of shear strength for the materials for postearthquake conditions may be neglected.







2. 1.0 <SF< 1.4

A strength value intermediate to the material's initial strength and residual undrained shear strength should be selected based on the level of residual excess pore water pressure expected to be generated by the ground shaking (e.g., Figure 10 of Seed and Harder, [6.4]).
3. SFS1.0
Reduction of the material shear strength to a residual undrained shear strength level shall be considered, as described in Section 3106F.3.2.
3106F.3.1.1 Simplified procedure. The simplified pro�cedure to evaluate liquefaction triggering shall follow Section 7 ofSCEC [6.3 1. Cyclic stress ratio ( CSR) is used to define seismic loading, in terms of the Design Peak
Ground Acceleration (DPGA) and Design Earthquake Magnitude (DEM). DPGA and DEM are addressed in
Section 3103F.4.2. CSR is defined as:
CSR =

(6-2)
where:
g = gravitational constant
o. = the vertical total stress
o'. = the vertical effective stress
rd = a stress reduction factor
rMsF = the magnitude scaling factor
For values ofrMsF and rd> see SCEC [6.3 1 Figures 7.2 and 7.3, respectively. To evaluate rMsF> the DEM value associated with DPGA shall be used.
3106F.3.1.2 Site specific response procedure. In lieu of the simplified procedure, either one-dimensional or two-dimensional site response analysis may be per�formed using the ground motion parameters discussed in Section 31 03F.4. The computed cyclic stresses at various points within the pertinent soil layers shall be expressed
as values of CSR.

3106F.3.2 Residual strength. The residual undrained shear strength may be estimated from Figure 7.7 of SCEC [6.31. When necessary, a conservative extrapolation of the range should be made. Under no circumstances, shall the residual shear strength be higher than the shear strength based on effective strength parameters.
The best estimate value should correspond to %from the lower bound of the range for a given value of equivalent clean sand SPT blowcount. When a value other than the "% value " is selected for the residual shear strength, the selec�tion shall be justified. An alternate method is provided in Stark and Mesri [6.51. The residual strength of liquefied soils may be obtained as a function of effective confining pressures if a justification is provided. The resulting resid�ual shear strength shall be used as the postearthquake shear strength of liquefied soils.






3106F.4 Other geotechnical hazards. For a SF less than 1.4, the potential for the following hazards shall be evaluated:
1.
Flow slides

2.
Slope movements

3.
Lateral spreading

4.
Ground settlement and differential settlement

5.
Other surface manifestations


These hazards shall be evaluated, using the residual shear strength described above (Section 3106F.3.2).
3106F.4.1 Stabilityof earth structures.Ifa slope failure could affect the M OT, a stability analysis of slopes and earth retaining structures shall be performed. The analysis shall use limit equilibrium methods that satisfy all of the force and/or moment equilibrium conditions and determine the slope stability safety factor.
1. Slope stability safety factor  1.2


Flow slides can be precluded; however, seismically induced ground movements shall be addressed.
2. 1.0 S Slope stability safety factor < 1.2
Seismically induced ground movements should be evalu�ated using the methods described below.
3. Slope stability safety factor< 1.0
Mitigation measures shall be implemented per Section 3106F.6.
31 06F.4.2 Simplified ground movement analysis. The seis�mically induced ground settlement may be estimated using Section 7.6 ofSCEC [6.31. Surface manifestation of lique�faction may be evaluated using Section 7. 7 ofSCEC.
Results shall be evaluated to determine if mitigation measures are required.
Seismically induced deformation or displacement of slopes shall be evaluated using the Makdisi-Seed [6.61 sim�plified method as described below.
The stability analysis shall be used with the residual shear strengths of soils to estimate the yield acceleration coeffi�cient, KY' associated with the critical potential movement plane. In general, the DPGA shall be used as Kmax (see [6.61) and DEMas the earthquake magnitude, M. These parame�ters shall be used together with the upper bound curves Fig�ures 9-11 of [6.61, to estimate the seismically induced ground movement along.the critical plane.
However, the value of Kmax may be different from the DPGA value to include the effects of amplification, incoher�ence, etc. When such adjustments are made in converting DPGA to KmaxJ a justification shall be provided. Linear interpolation using the upper bound curves in Figure 10 (ordinate scale should be divided by 10) in [6.61 or Figure 4-10 in Ferritto et al [ 6. 71 can be used to estimate the seis�mically induced ground movement for other earthquake magnitudes.

1.
When the resulting displacement from the screening method is > 0.1 ft., the Makdisi-Seed simplified method or other similar methods shall be used to esti�mate lateral spreading.

If the computed displacements using simplified meth�ods are > 0.5ft., the use of a detailed ground move�ment analysis (see Section 31 06F.4.3) may be considered.

4.
If the final resulting displacement, regardless of the method used, remains > 0.5 ft., it shall be considered in the structural analysis.


3106F.4.3 Detailedground movement analysis. As an alternative to the simplified methods discussed above, a two-dimensional (2-D) equivalent linear or nonlinear dynamic analysis of the MOT and/or slopes and earth retaining systems may be performed.
An equivalent linear analysis is adequate when the stiff�ness and/or strength of the soils involved are likely to degrade by less than one-third, during seismic excitation of less than 0.5 g's. Appropriate time histories need to be obtained to calculate seismically induced displacement (see Section 31 03R4.2 ). Such analysis should account for the accumulating effects of displacement if double-integration of acceleration time histories is used. The seismic stresses or stress time histories from equivalent linear analysis may be used to estimate seismically induced deformation.
A nonlinear analysis should be used if the stiffness and/or strength of the soils involved are likely to degrade by more than one-third during seismic motion.
If the structure is included in the analysis, the ground motion directly affects the structural response. Otherwise, the uncoupled, calculated movement of the soil on the struc�ture shall be evaluated.
31 06F.5 Soil structure interaction. Two separate loading con�ditions for the piles shall be considered: ( 1) Inertial loading under seismic conditions, and (2) Kinematic loading from lat�eral ground spreading. Inertial loading is associated with earthquake-induced lateral loading on a structure, while kine�matic loading refers to loading on foundation piles from earth�quake induced lateral deformations of the slope/ embankment/dike system. Simultaneous application of these loading conditions shall be evaluated with due consideration of the phasing and locations of these loads on foundation ele�ments. The foundation design shall meet the structural perfor-

MARINE OIL TERMINALS
mance requirements of this Code, when subjected to both iner�tial and kinematic loadings.
3106F.5.1 Soil parameters. Soil structure interaction (SSI) shall be addressed for the seismic evaluation of MOT struc�tures. SSI may consist of linear or non-linear springs (and possibly dash-pots) for various degrees of freedom, includ�ing horizontal, vertical, torsional, and rotational, as required by the structural analysis.


Pile capacity parameters may be evaluated using the pro�cedures in Chapter4 ofFEMA 356 [6.9]. The "p-y" curves, "t-z" curves, and tip load -displacement curves for piles (nonlinear springs for horizontal and vertical modes and nonlinear vertical springs for the pile tip, respectively) and deep foundations shall be evaluated using Section 6 of API RP 2A-WSD [6.10] including the consideration of pile group effects. Equivalent springs (and dashpots) represent�ing the degrading properties of soils may be developed.
Where appropriate, alternative procedures can be used to develop these parameters. Rationale for the use of alterna�tive procedures shall be provided. One simplified method is presented in Chapter 4 of the UFC 3-220-01A [6.11] and provides deflection and moment for an isolated pile, subject to a lateral load.
3106F.5.2 Shallow foundations. Shallow foundations shall be assumed to move with the ground. Springs and dashpots may be evaluated as per Gazetas [6. 12].
3106F.5.3 Underground structures. Buried flexible struc�tures or buried portions of flexible structures including piles and pipelines shall be assumed to deform with estimated ground movement at depth.
As the soil settles, it shall be assumed to apply shear forces to buried structures or buried portions of structures including deep foundations.
3106R6 Mitigation measures and alternatives. If the hazards and consequences addressed in Sections 3106R3 and 3106R4 are beyond the specified range, the following options shall be considered:
1.
Perform a more sophisticated analysis

2.
Modify the structure

3.
Modify the foundation soil



Examples of possible measures to modify foundation soils are provided in Table 4-1 of [6.7].

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AND
DESIGN OF COMPONENTS

3107F.l General.


3107F.l.l Purpose.This section establishes the minimum performance standards for structural components. Evalua�tion procedures for seismic performance, strength and deformation characteristics of concrete, steel and timber components are prescribed herein.

MARINE OIL TERMINALS
3107F.2.1.1 Material properties. Material properties of existing components, not determined from testing proce�dures, and of new components, shall be established using the following methodology.
The strength of structural components shall be evalu�ated based on the following values (Section 5.3 of [7.1] andpp. 3-73 and 3-74 of [7.2]):
Specified material strength shall be used for nonduc�tile components (shear controlled), all mechanical, elec�trical and mooring equipment (attachments to the deck) and for all non seismic load combinations: (7-1a) (7-1b) (7-1c)


In addition, these values (7-1a, 7-1b and 7-1c) may be used conservatively as alternatives to determine the nominal strength of ductile components (N).
Expected lower bound estimates of material strength shall be used for determination of moment-curvature relations and nominal strength of all ductile compo�nents:
f =1.3f (7-2a) fy = 1.1/y (7-2b) /p = 1.0/p (7-2c)
Upper bound estimates of material strength shall be used for the determination of moment-curvature rela�tions, to obtain the feasible maximum demand on capac�ity protected members:
f = 1.7fc 	(7-3a)
fy = 1.3/y 	(7-3b)
/p = 1.1/p 	(7-3c)
where:
fc = Specified compressive strength of concrete

[y = Specified yield strength of reinforcement or
specified minimum yield stress steel
:{p = Specified yield strength of prestress strands

"Capacity Design " (Section 5.3 of[7.1]) ensures that the strength at protected components (such as pile caps and decks), joints and actions (such as shear), is greater than the maximum feasible demand (over strength), based on realistic upper bound estimates of plastic hinge flexural strength. An additional series of nonlinear anal�yses using moment curvature characteristics of pile hinges may be required.
Alternatively, if a moment-curvature analysis is per�formed that takes into account the strain hardening of the steel, the demands used to evaluate the capacity pro�tected components may be estimated by multiplying the moment-curvature values by 1.25.
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE




Based on a historical review of the building materials used in the twentieth century, guidelines for tensile and yield properties of concrete reinforcing bars and the com�pressive strength of structural concrete have been estab�lished (see Tables 6-1 to 6-3 ofFEMA 356 [7.3 ]. The values shown in these tables can be used as default properties, only if as-built information is not available and testing is not performed. The values in Tables 31F-7-1 and 31F-7-2, are adjusted according to equations (7-1) through (7-3).
31 07R2.1.2 Knowledge factor (k).Knowledge factor, k, shall be applied on a component basis.
The following information is required, at a minimum, for a component strength assessment:
1. Original construction records, including draw�ings and specifications.


2.
A set of "as-built" drawings and/or sketches, doc�umenting both gravity and lateral systems (Section 31 02F.1.5) and any postconstruction modification data.

3.
A visual condition survey, for structural compo�nents including identification of the size, location and connections of these components.

If expected lower bound of material strength Section 3107F.2.1.1 Equations (7-2a, 7-2b, 7-2c) are used in obtaining the nominal shear strength, a new nonlinear analysis utilizing the upper bound estimate of material strength Section 31 07F.2.1.1 Equations (7-3a, 7-3b, 7-3c) shall be used to obtain the plastic hinge shear demand. An alternative conservative approach is to multiply the maximum shear demand, Vmax

Shear capacity shall be based on nominal material strengths, and reduction factors according to ACI-318 [7.5].
As an alternative, the method of Kowalski and Priestley [7. 7] may be used. Their method is based on a three-parameter model with separate contributions to shear strength from concrete (V J, transverse reinforce�ment (V,), and axial load (Vp) to obtain nominal shear strength (V J:

3107F.2.8 Batter piles.
3107F.2.8.1 Existing ordinary batter piles. Wharves or piers with ordinary (not fused, plugged or having a seis�mic release mechanism) batter piles typically have a very stiff response when subjected to lateral loads in the direction of the batter. The structure often maintains most of its initial stiffness all the way to failure of the first
row of batter piles. Since batter piles most likely will fail under a Level 2 seismic event, the following method may be used to evaluate the post-failure behavior of the wharf or pier:

1.
Identify the failure mechanism of the batter pile-deck connection (refer to Section 31 04F.4. 7) for typical failure scenarios) and the correspond�ing lateral displacement.

2.
Release the lateral load between the batter pile and the deck when the lateral failure displacement is reached.

3.
Push on the structure until subsequent failure( s)have been identified.



As an example, following these. steps will result in a force-displacement (pushover) curve similar to the one shown in Figure 31F-7-14 for ti wharf supported by one row of batter piles.
Displacement
FIGURE 31 F-7-14 PUSHOVER CURVE FOR ORDINARY BATTER PILES

When the row of batter piles fail in tension or shear, stored energy will be released. The structure will therefore experience a lateral displacement demand following the nonductile pile failures. If the structure can respond to this displacement demand without exceeding other structurallimita�


529
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE

MARINE OIL TERMINALS




tions, it may be assumed that the structure is stable and will start to respond to further shaking with a much longer period and corresponding lower seis�mic demands. The whaif structure may therefore be able to sustain larger seismic demands follow�ing the loss of the batter piles than before the loss of pile capacity, because of a much softer seismic response.
The area under the pushover curve before the batter pile failures is compared to the equivalent area under the post failure pushover curve (refer to Figure 3IF-7-14). If no other structural limita�tions are reached with the new displacement demand, it is assumed that the structure is capable of absorbing the energy. It should be noted that even though the shear failure is nonductile, it is expected that energy will be absorbed and the

damping will increase during the damage of the piles. The above method is, therefore, considered conservative.
Following the shear failure of a batter pile row, the period of the structure increases such that equal displacement can be assumed when estimat�
ing the post-failure displacement demand. The new period may be estimated from the initial stiff�ness of the post-failure system as shown in Figure 31F-7-14. A new displacement demand can then be calculated in accordance with Section 31 04F.2.

3107F.2.8.2 Nonordinary Batter Piles. For the case of a plugged batter pile system, an appropriate displacement force relationship considering plug friction may be used in modeling the structural system.
For fused and seismic release mechanism batter pile systems, a nonlinear modeling procedure shall be used and peer reviewed (Section 3101F.6.1).
31 07F.2.9 Concrete pile caps with concrete deck. Pile caps and decks are capacity protected components. Use the pro�cedure of Section 31 07F.2.5. 7 to establish the over strength demand of the plastic hinges. Component capacity shall be based on nominal material strengths, and reduction factors according to ACI-318 [7.5].
3107F.2.9.1 Component acceptance/damage criteria. For new pile caps and deck, Levell seismic peiformance shall utilize the design methods inACI-318 [7.5]; Level2 seismic peiformance shall be limited to the following strains:

3.

If corrosion inhibitors are used, a cover of two-and-one-half inches is acceptable.

5.

Section 3104F.2.2 discusses existing material properties. At a minimum, the type and grade of wood shall be established. The adjusted design stress values in the ANSI/AF&PA NDS [7.9] may be used as default values by replacing the Format Conversion Factor of ANSI/AF&PA NDS [7.9] with the factor 2.8 divided by the Resistance Fac�tor (Table Nl [7.9 ]).


For deck components, the adjusted design stresses shall be limited to the values of ANSI/AF&PA NDS [7.9]. Piling deformation lim�its shall be calculated based on the strain limits in accordance with Section 3107F.3.3.3.
The values shown in the ANSI!AF&PA NDS

3107F.3.3.2 Displacement capacity. A distinction shall be made between a pier-type pile, with a long unsup�ported length and a wharf-landside-type pile with a short unsupported length between the deck and soil. The effec�tive length, L, is the distance between the pinned deck/pile connection and in-ground fixity as shown in Figure 31F-7-15. For pier-type (long unsupported length) vertical piles, three simplified procedures to
determine fixity or displacement capacity are described in UFC 4-151-10 [7.10], UFC 3-220-01A [7.11] and Chai [7. 12].


In order to determine fixity in soft soils, another alter�native is to use Table 31F-7-8.
