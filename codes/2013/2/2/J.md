]106.2.1 GeneraL The requirements of this section shall
/\

apply to temporary and permanent earth retaining shoring
using soldier piles and lagging with or without tie-back
anchors in soil or rock, only when existing or new DSA�SS, DSA-SS/CC or OSHPD 1 or 4 facilities are affected.
Shoring used as construction means and methods only,
which does not affect existing or new DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC
or OSHPD 1 or 4 facilities, are not regulated by DSA or
OSHPD and shall satisfy the requirements of the authori�ties having jurisdiction.



Design, construction, testing and inspection shall sat�
isfy the requirements of this code except as modified in
Sections J106.2.2 through JJ06.2.8.

]106.2.2 Duration. Shoring shall be considered tempo�
rary when elements of the shoring will be exposed to site
conditions for a period of less than one ( 1) year, and shall
be considered permanent otherwise. Permanent shoring
shall account for the increase in lateral soil pressure due

to earthquake. At the end of the construction period, the
existing and new structures shall not rely on the tempo�
rary shoring for support in any way. Wood components
shall not be used for permanent shoring lasting more than
two (2) years. Wood components of the temporary shoring
that may affect the performance of perman ent structure
shall be removed after the shoring is no longer required.



All components of the shoring shall have corrosion
protection or preservative treatment for their expected
duration. Wood components of the temporary shoring that
will not be removed shall be treated in accordance with
A WPA Ul (Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B
and Section 5.2), and shall be identified in accordance
with Section 2303.1.8.1.

traffic or other sources shall be considered in design. If
the footing surcharge is located within the semicircular
distribution or bulb of earth pressure (when shoring is
located close to a footings), lagging shall be designed for
lateral earth pressure due to footing surcharge. Soil arch�
ing effects may be considered in the design of lagging.
Underpinning of the footing may be used in lieu of design�
ing the shoring and lagging for surcharge pressure. Alter�
natively, continuously contacting drilled pier shafts near
the footings shall be permitted. The lateral surcharge
design pressure shall be derived using Boussinesq equa�
tions modified for the distribution of stresses in an elastic
medium due to a uniform, concentrated or line surface
load as appropriate and soil arching effects.

]106.2.4 Design and testing: Except for the modifications
as set forth in Sections J106.2.4.1 and J106.2.4.2 below,
all Prestressed Rock and Soil Tie-back Anchors shall be
designed and tested in accordance with PTI Recommenda�
tions for Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors (PTI-2004 ).
