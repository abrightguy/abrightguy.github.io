The edge dis�tance and spacing are permitted to be reduced to 50 percent of the values specified with an equal reduction in allowable ser�vice load. Where edge distance and spacing are reduced less than 50 percent, the allowable service load shall be deter�mined by linear interpolation.
1908.4 Increase in allowable load. Increase of the values in Table 1908.2 by one-third is permitted where the provisions of Section 1605.3.2 permit an increase in allowable stress for wind loading.
1908.5 Increase for special inspection. Where special inspection is provided for the installation of anchors, a 100�percent increase in the allowable tension values of Table 1908.2 is permitted. No increase in shear value is permitted.

a.
Lines defining areas are approximate only. Local areas can be more or less severe than indicated by the region classification.

b.
A "severe" classification is where weather conditions encourage or require the use of deicing chemicals or where there is potential for a continuous presence of moisture during frequent cycles of freezing and thawing. A "moderate" classification is where weather conditions occasionally expose concrete in the presence of moisture to freezing and thawing, but where deicing chemicals are not generally used. A "negligible" classification is where weather conditions rarely expose concrete in the presence of moisture to freezing and thawing.

c.
Alaska and Hawaii are classified as severe and negligible, respectively.

The provisions of this section shall govern the allowable stress design of headed bolts and headed stud anchors cast in normal-weight concrete for purposes of trans�mitting structural loads from one connected element to the other. These provisions do not apply to anchors installed in hardened concrete or where load combinations include earth-

quake loads or effects. The bearing area of headed anchors shall be not less than one and one-half times the shank area. Where strength design is used, or where load combinations include earthquake loads or effects, the design strength of anchors shall be determined in accordance with Section 1909A. Bolts shall conform to ASTM A 307 or an approved equivalent.

The edge distance and spacing are permitted to be reduced to SO percent of the values specified with an equal reduction in allowable service load. Where edge distance and spacing are reduced less than SO percent, the allowable service load shall be determined by linear interpolation.
1908A.4 Increase in allowable load. Increase of the values in Table 1908A.2 by one-third is permitted where the provi�sions of Section 160SA.3.2 permit an increase in allowable stress for wind loading.
1908A.5 Increase for special -inspection. Where special inspection is provided for the installation of anchors, a 100�percent increase in the allowable tension values of Table
1908A.2 is permitted. No increase in shear value is permitted.
