G102.1 General. This appendix, in conjunction with the Cal�ifornia Building Code, provides minimum requirements for development located in flood hazard areas, including the sub�division of land; installation of utilities; placement and replacement of manufactured homes; new construction and repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or additions to new con�struction; substantial improvement of existing buildings and structures, including restoration after damage, temporary structures, and temporary or permanent storage, utility and miscellaneous Group U buildings and structures, and certain building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2.





G102.2 Establishment of flood hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are established in Section 1612.3 of the California Building Code, adopted by the applicable governing authority on [INSERT DATE].
SECTION G1 03
POWERS AND DUTIES


Gl03.1 Permit applications. The building official shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed development sites Will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed development site is in a flood hazard area, all site development activities (including grading, filling, utility installation and drainage modification), all new construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes) and certain building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2 shall be designed and constructed With methods, practices and materials that minimize flood damage and that are in accor�dance with this code and ASCE 24.
G103.2 Other permits. It shall be the responsibility of the building official to assure that approval of a proposed devel�opment shall not be given until proof that necessary permits have been granted by federal or state agencies having juris�diction over such development.
G103.3 Determination of design flood elevations. If design flood elevations are not specified, the building official is authorized to require the applicant to:
1.
Obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from a federal, state or other source, or

2.
Determine the design flood elevation in accordance With accepted hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Such analyses shall be performed and sealed by a registered design professional. Studies, analyses and computations shall be submitted in suffi�cient detail to allow review and approval by the build�ing official. The accuracy of data submitted for such determination shall be the responsibility of the appli�cant.


G103.4 Activities in riverine flood hazard areas. In river�ine flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified but floodways have not been designated, the build�ing official shall not permit any new construction, substantial improvement or other development, including fill, unless the


2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE




applicant demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the pro�posed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated flood hazard area
encroachment, will not increase the design flood elevation more than 1 foot (305 rnm) at any point within the community.
G103.5 Floodway encroachment. Prior to issuing a permit for any floodway encroachment, including fill, new construc�tion, substantial improvements and other development or land-disturbing activity, the building official shall require submission of a certification, along with supporting technical data, that demonstrates that such development will not cause any increase of the level of the base flood.
G103.5.1 Floodway revisions. A floodway encroachment that increases the level of the base flood is authorized if the applicant has applied for a conditional Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) revision and has received the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

G103.6 Watercourse alteration. Prior to issuing a permit for any alteration or relocation of any watercourse, the building official shall require the applicant to provide notification of the proposal to the appropriate authorities of all affected adja�cent government jurisdictions, as well as appropriate state agencies. A copy of the notification shall be maintained in the permit records and submitted to FEMA.
G103.6.1 Engineering analysis. The building official shall require submission of an engineering analysis which demonstrates that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse will not be decreased. Such watercourses shall be maintained in a manner which preserves the channel's flood-carrying capacity.

G103.7 Alterations in coastal areas. Prior to issuing a per�mit for any alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands in flood hazard areas subject to high velocity wave action, the building official shall require submission of an engineering analysis which demonstrates that the proposed alteration will not increase the potential for flood damage.
G103.8 Records. The building official shall maintain a per�manent record of all permits issued in flood hazard areas, including copies of inspection reports and certifications required in Section 1612.
SECTION G1 04

PERMITS G104.1 Required. Any person, owner or authorized agent who intends to conduct any development in a flood hazard area shall first make application to the building official and shall obtain the required permit.

ing effects may be considered in the design of lagging.
Underpinning of the footing may be used in lieu of design�
ing the shoring and lagging for surcharge pressure. Alter�
natively, continuously contacting drilled pier shafts near
the footings shall be permitted. The lateral surcharge
design pressure shall be derived using Boussinesq equa�
tions modified for the distribution of stresses in an elastic
medium due to a uniform, concentrated or line surface
load as appropriate and soil arching effects.
