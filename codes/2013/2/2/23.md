2308.8.1 Bearing. Except where supported on a l-inch by 4-inch (25.4 mm by 102 mm) ribbon strip and nailed to the adjoining stud, the ends of each joist shall not have less than 11/2 inches (38 mm) of bearing on wood or metal, or less than 3 inches (76 mm) on masonry.
2308.8.2 Framing details. Joists shall be supported later�ally at the ends and at each support by solid blocking except where the ends of the joists are nailed to a header, band or rim joist or to an adjoining stud or by other means. Solid blocking shall not be less than 2 inches (51mm) in thickness and the full depth of the joist. Notches on the ends of joists shall not exceed one-fourth the joist depth. Holes bored in joists shall not be within 2 inches (51 mm) of the top or bottom of the joist, and the diameter of any such hole shall not exceed one-third the depth of the joist. Notches in the top or bottom of joists shall not exceed one�sixth the depth and shall not be located in the middle third of the span.
Joist framing from opposite sides of a beam, girder or partition shall be lapped at least 3 inches (76 mm) or the opposing joists shall be tied together in an approved man�ner.
Joists framing into the side of a wood girder shall be supported by framing anchors or on ledger strips not less than 2 inches by 2 inches (51 mm by 51 mm).

Cuts, notches and holes bored in trusses, structural composite lumber, structural glue-laminated members or !-joists are not permitted except where permitted by the manufac�turer's recommendations or where the effects of such alterations are specifically considered in the design of
the member by a registered design professional.
2308.8.3 Framing around openings. Trimmer and header joists shall be doubled, or of lumber of equivalent cross section, where the span of the header exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). The ends of header joists more than 6 feet (1829 mm) long shall be supported by framing anchors or joist hangers unless bearing on a beam, partition or wall. Tail joists over 12 feet (3658 mm) long shall be supported at the header by framing anchors or on ledger strips not less than 2 inches by 2 inches (51 mm by 51 mm).
2308.8.4 Supporting bearing partitions. Bearing parti�tions parallel to joists shall be supported on beams, gird�ers, doubled joists, walls or other bearing partitions. Bearing partitions perpendicular to joists shall not be off�set from supporting girders, walls or partitions more than the joist depth unless such joists are of sufficient size to carry the additional load.
2308.8.5 Lateral support. Floor, attic and roof framing with a nominal depth-to-thickness ratio greater than or equal to 5:1 shall have one edge heldin line for the entire span. Where the nominal depth-to-thickness ratio of the framing member exceeds 6:1, there shall be one line of bridging for each 8 feet (2438 mm) of span, unless both edges of the member are held in line. The bridging shall consist of not less than l-inch by 3-inch (25 mm by 76

spacing of studs shall be in accordance with Table
2308.9.1 except that utility-grade studs shall not be spaced

more than 16 inches (406 mm) o.c., or support more than a
roof and ceiling, or exceed 8 feet (2438 mm) in height for
exterior walls and load-bearing walls or 10 feet (3048 mm)
for interior nonload-bearing walls. Studs shall be continu�
ous from a support at the sole plate to a support at the top
plate to resist loads perpendicular to the wall. The support
shall be a foundation or floor, ceiling or roof diaphragm or
shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering
practice.


Exception: Jack studs, trimmer studs and cripple studs
at openings in walls that comply with Table 2308.9.5.

NJ -Number of jack studs required to support each end. Where the number of required jack studs equals one, the headers are permitted to be supported by an approved framing anchor attached to the full-height wall stud and to the header.




2308.9.7 Openings in interior nonbearing partitions.
Openings in nonbearing partitions are permitted to be framed with single studs and headers. Each end of a lintel or header shall have a length of bearing of not less than 1 1I2 inches (38 mm.) for the full width of the lintel.
2308.9.8 Pipes in walls. Stud partitions containing plumb�ing, heating or other pipes shall be so framed and the joists underneath so spaced as to give proper clearance for the piping. Where a partition containing such piping runs par�allel to the floor joists, the joists underneath such parti�tions shall be doubled and spaced to permit the passage of such pipes and shall be bridged. Where plumbing, heating or other pipes are placed in or partly in a partition, necessi�tating the cutting of the soles or plates, a metal tie not less than 0.058 inch (1.47 mm) (16 galvanized gage) and 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) wide shall be fastened to each plate across and to each side of the opening with not less than six 16d nails.



2308.9.9 Bridging. Unless covered by interior or exterior wall coverings or sheathing meeting the minimum require�ments of this code, stud partitions or walls with studs hav�ing a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceeding 50 shall have bridging not less than 2 inches (5 1 mm) in thickness and of the same width as the studs fitted snugly and nailed thereto to provide adequate lateral support. Bridging shall be placed in every stud cavity and at a frequency such that no stud so braced shall have a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceeding 50 with the height of the stud measured between horizontal framing and bridging or between bridging, whichever is greater.
2308.9.10 Cutting and notching. In exterior walls and bearing partitions, any wood stud is permitted to be cut or notched to a depth not exceeding 25 percent of its width. Cutting or notching of studs to a depth not greater than 40 percent of the width of the stud is permitted in nonbearing partitions supporting no loads other than the weight of the partition.

a.
The uplift connection requirements are based on a 30-foot mean roof height located in Exposure B. For Exposure CorD and for other mean roof heights, multiply the above loads by the adjustment coefficients below.

b.
The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 16 inches on center and multiply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center.

c.
The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load.

()
d.
The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the above loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads found in the table. The overhang loads are also based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang projection and added to the roof uplift value in the table.

e.
The uplift connection requirements are based upon wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.6.3 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the comer of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8.

f.
For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down).

g.
Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of Vasd and roof spans.


h.
The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications.

i.
Vasd shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.1.












2308.9.11 Bored holes. A hole not greater in diameter than 40.percent of the stud width is permitted to be bored in any wood stud. Bored holes not greater than 60 percent of the width of the stud are permitted in nonbearing parti�tions or in any wall where each bored stud is doubled, pro�vided not more than two such successive doubled studs are so bored.
In no case shall the edge of the bored hole be nearer than 5/8 inch (15.9 mm) to the edge of the stud.
Bored holes shall not be located at the same section of stud as a cut or notch.
2308.10 Roof and ceiling framing. The framing details required in this section apply to roofs having a minimum slope of three units vertical in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope) or greater. Where the roof slope is less than three units vertical in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope), members supporting rafters and ceiling joists such as ridge board, hips and valleys shall be designed as beams.
2308.10.1 Wind uplift. The roof construction shall have rafter and truss ties to the wall below. Resultant uplift

loads shall be transferred to the foundation using a contin�uous load path. The rafter or truss to wall connection shall comply with Tables 2304.9.1 and 2308.10.1.
2308.10.2 Ceiling joist spans. Allowable spans for ceiling joists shall be in accordance with Table 2308.10.2(1) or 2308.10.2(2). For other grades and species, refer to the
AF &PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters.

2308.10.3 Rafter spans. Allowable spans for rafters shall be in accordance with Table 2308.10.3(1), 2308.10.3(2), 2308.10.3(3), 2308.10.3(4), 2308.10.3(5) or 2308.10.3(6). For other grades and species, refer to the AF &PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters.
2308.10.4 Ceiling joist and rafter framing. Rafters shall be framed directly opposite each other at the ridge. There shall be a ridge board at least l-inch (25 mm) nominal thickness at ridges and not less in depth than the cut end of the rafter. At valleys and hips, there shall be a single val�ley or hip rafter not less than 2-inch (5 1 mm) nominal thickness and not less in depth than the cut end of the raf�ter.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 rnm, 1 foot = 304.8 rnm, 1 pound per square foot = 47.8 N/m2.
a.
40d box (5" x 0.162") or 16d sinker (3\" x 0. 148") nails are permitted to be substituted for 16d common (311/' x 0.16") nails.

b.
Nailing requirements are permitted to be reduced 25 percent if nails are clinched.

c.
Rafter tie heel joint connections are not required where the ridge is supported by a load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam.

d.
When intermediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements are permitted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span.

e.
Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joist to ceiling joist lap splices.

f.
Connected members shall be of sufficient size to prevent splitting due to nailing.

g.
For snow loads less than 30 pounds per square foot, the required number of nails is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the ratio of actual snow load plus 10 divided by 40, but not less than the number required for no snow load.







2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE



2308.10.4.1 Ceiling joist and rafter connections.
Ceiling joists and rafters shall be nailed to each other and the assembly shall be nailed to the top wall plate in accordance with Tables 2304.9.1 and 2308.10.1. Ceil�ing joists shall be continuous or securely joined where they meet over interior partitions and fastened to adja�cent rafters in accordance with Tables 2308.10.4.1 and 2304.9.1 to provide a continuous rafter tie across the


�building where such joists are parallel to the rafters. Ceiling joists shall have a bearing surface of not less than 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) on the top plate at each end.
