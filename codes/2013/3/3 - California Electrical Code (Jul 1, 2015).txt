Preface 

This document is the 3rd of 12 Parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building Standards Code. This Part is known as the California0 Electrical Code and incorporates, by adoption, the 2011 edition of the National Electrical Code of the National Fire Protection Association with the California amendments 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legislature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature 0 delegated authority to various State agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building regulations or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipulated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 
A city, county or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effective sooner than the date filed with the California Building Standards Commission and in no case sooner than the effective date of this edition of California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing. 
To familiarize yourself with the format of this code, it is suggested that users review the following contents: 
• 
How To Distinguish Model Code Language From California Amendments 

• 
Matrix Adoption Tables, located at the beginning of each chapter.

This edition of NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, was prepared by the National Electrical Code Committee and acted on by NFPA at its June Association Technical Meeting held June 7-10, 2010, in Las Vegas, NV.It was issued by the Standards Council on August 5, 2010, with an effective date of August 25, 2010, and supersedes all previous editions. 
This edition ofNFPA 70 was approved as an American National Standard on August 25, 2010. 
History and DevelopmentHistory and Development of the National Electrical Code® 
The National Fire Protection Association has acted as sponsor of the National Electrical Code since 1911. The original Code document was developed in 1897 as a result of the united efforts of various insurance, electrical, architectural, and allied interests. 
In accordance with the provisions of the NFPA Regulations Governing Committee Projects, a National Electrical Code Committee Report on Proposals containing proposed amendments to the 2008 National Electrical Code was published by NFPA in July 2009. This report recorded the actions of the various Code-Making Panels and the Correlating Committee of the National Electrical Code Committee on each proposal that had been made to revise the 2008 Code. The report was circulated to all members of the National Electrical Code Committee and was made available to other interested NFPA members and to the public for review and comment. Following the close of the public comment period, the Code-Making Panels met, acted on each comment, and reported their action to the Correlating Committee. NFPA published the National Electrical Code Committee Report on Comments in March 2010, which recorded the actions of the Code-Making Panels and the Correlating Committee on each public comment to the National Electrical Code Committee Report on Proposals. The National Electrical Code Committee Report on Proposals and the National Electrical Code Committee Report on Comments were presented to the 2010 June Association Technical Meeting for adoption. 
NFP A has an Electrical Section that provides particular opportunity for NFP A members interested in electrical safety to become better informed and to contribute to the development of the National Electrical Code and other NFPA electrical standards. At the Electrical Section Codes and Standards Review Session held at the 2010 NFPA Conference and Expo, Section members had opportunity to discuss and review the report of the National Electrical Code Committee prior to the adoption of this edition of the Code by the Association at its 20 1 0 June Technical Session. 
This 52nd edition supersedes all other previous editions, supplements, and printings dated 1897, 1899, 1901, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1907, 1909, 1911, 1913, 1915, 1918, 1920, 1923, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1965, 1968, 1971, 1975, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
This Code is purely advisory as far as NFPA is concerned. It is made available for a wide variety of both public and private uses in the interest of life and property protection. These include both use in law and for regulatory purposes, and use in private self-regulation and standardization activities such as insurance underwriting, building and facilities construction and management, and product testing and certification

90.1 Purpose. 
(A) 
Practical Safeguarding. The purpose of this Code is the practical safeguarding of persons and property from hazards arising from the use of electricity. 

(B) 
Adequacy. This Code contains provisions that are considered necessary for safety. Compliance therewith and proper maintenance results in an installation that is essentially free from hazard but not necessarily efficient, convenient, or adequate for good service or future expansion of electrical use. 


Informational Note: Hazards often occur because of overloading of wiring systems by methods or usage not in conformity with this Code. This occurs because initial wiring did not provide for increases in the use of electricity. An initial adequate installation and reasonable provisions for system changes provide for future increases in the use of electricity. 

(C) 
Intention. This Code is not intended as a design specification or an instruction manual for untrained persons. 

(D) 
Relation to Other International Standards. The requirements in this Code address the fundamental principles of protection for safety contained in Section 131 of International Electrotechnical Commission Standard 60364-1, Electrical Installations of Buildings. 


Informational Note: IEC 60364-1, Section 131, contains

mandatory application by governmental bodies that exercise legal jurisdiction over electrical installations, including signaling and communications systems, and for use by insurance inspectors. The authority having jurisdiction for enforcement of the Code has the responsibility for making interpretations of the rules, for deciding on the approval of equipment and materials, and for granting the special permission contemplated in a number of the rules. 
By special permission, the authority having jurisdiction may waive specific requirements in this Code or permit alternative methods where it is assured that equivalent objectives can be achieved by establishing and maintaining effective safety. 
This Code may require new products, constructions, or materials that may not yet be available at the time the Code is adopted. In such event, the authority having jurisdiction may permit the use of the products, constructions, or materials that comply with the most recent previous edition of this Code adopted by the jurisdiction. 
90.5 Mandatory Rules, Permissive Rules, and Explanatory MateriaL 
(A) Mandatory Rules. Mandatory rules of this Code are those that identify actions that are specifically required or prohibited and are characterized by the use of the terms shall or shall not. 
ARTICLE 90 -INTRODUCTION 


(B) 
Permissive Rules. Permissive rules of this Code are those that identify actions that are allowed but not required, are normally used to describe options or alternative methods, and are characterized by the use of the terms shall be permitted or shall not be required. 

(C) 
Explanatory Material. Explanatory material, such as references to other standards, references to related sections of this Code, or information related to a Code rule, is included in this Code in the form of ­notes. Such notes are informational only and are not enforceable as requirements of this Code. 


Brackets containing section references to another NFP A document are for informational purposes only and are provided asa guide to indicate the source of the extracted text. These bracketed references immediately follow the extracted text. 
Informational Note: The format and language used in this Code follows guidelines established by NFP A and published in the NEC Style Manual. Copies of . this manual can be obtained from NFP A. 

90.6 Formal Interpretations. 
To promote uniformity of interpretation and application of the provisions of this Code, formal interpretation procedures have been established and are found in the NFPA Regulations Governing Committee Projects. 
90.7 Examination of Equipment for Safety. 
For specific items of equipment and materials referred to in this Code, examinations for safety made under standard conditions provide a basis for approval where the record is made generally available through promulgation by organizations properly equipped and qualified for experimental testing, inspections of the run of goods at factories, and service-value determination through field inspections. This avoids the necessity for repetition of examinations by different examiners, frequently with inadequate facilities for such work, and the confusion that would result from conflicting reports on the suitability of devices and materials examined for a given purpose. 
It is the intent of this Code that factory-installed internal wiring or the construction of equipment need not be inspected at the time of installation of the equipment, except to detect alterations or damage, if the equipment has been listed by a qualified electrical testing laboratory that is recognized as having the facilities described in the preceding paragraph and that requires suitability for installation in accordance with this Code.

0

provide convenience and safety of operation. 
(B) Number of Circuits in Enclosures. It is elsewhere provided in this Code that the number of wires and circuits confined in a single enclosure be varyingly restricted. Limiting the number of circuits in a single enclosure minimizes the effects from a short circuit or ground fault in one circuit. 
90.9 Units of Measurement. 
(A) 
Measurement System of Preference. For the purpose of this Code, metric units of measurement are in accordance with the modernized metric system known as the International System of Units (SI). 

(B) 
Dual System of Units. SI units shall appear first, and inch-pound units shall immediately follow in parentheses. Conversion from inch-pound units to SI units shall be based on hard conversion except as provided in 90.9(C). 

(C) 
Permitted Uses of Soft Conversion. The cases given in 90.9(C)(l) through (C)(4) shall not be required to use hard conversion and shall be permitted to use soft conversion. 

(1) 
Trade Sizes. Where the actual measured size of a product is not the same as the nominal size, trade size designators shall be used rather than dimensions. Trade practices shall be followed in all cases. 

(2) 
Extracted Material. Where material is extracted from another standard, the context of the original material shall 



C)

not be compromised or violated. Any editing of the extracted text shall be confined to making the style consistent with that of the NEC. 
(3)

300.20 Induced Currents in Ferrous Metal Enclosures or Ferrous Metal Raceways. 
(A) Conductors Grouped Together. Where conductors carrying alternating current are installed in ferrous metal enclosures or ferrous metal raceways, they shall be arranged so as to avoid heating the surrounding ferrous metal by induction. To accomplish this, all phase conductors and, where used, the grounded conductor and all equipment grounding conductors shall be grouped together. 
Exception No. 1: Equipment grounding conductors for certain existing installations shall be permitted to be installed separate from their associated circuit conductors where run in accordance with the provisions of250.130(C). 
Exception No. 2: A single conductor shall be permitted to be installed in a ferromagnetic enclosure and used for skin-effect heating in accordance with the provisions of 
426.42 and 427.47. 
(B) Individual Conductors. Where a single conductor carrying alternating current passes through metal with magnetic properties, the inductive effect shall be minimized by (1) cutting slots in the metal between the individual holes through which the individual conductors pass or (2) passing all the conductors in the circuit through an insulating wall sufficiently large for all of the conductors of the circuit. 
Exception: In the case of circuits supplying vacuum or electric-discharge lighting systems or signs or X-ray apparatus, the currents carried by the conductors are so small that the inductive heating effect can be ignored where these conductors are placed in metal enclosures or pass through metal. 
Informational Note: Because aluminum is not a magnetic metal, there will be no heating due to hysteresis; however, induced currents will be present. They will not be of sufficient magnitude to require grouping of conductors or special treatment in passing conductors through aluminum wall sections. 

300.21 Spread of Fire or Products of Combustion. 
Electrical installations in hollow spaces, vertical shafts, and ventilation or air-handling ducts shall be made so that the possible spread of fire or products of combustion will not be substantially increased. Openings around electrical

approved methods to maintain the fire resistance rating. 
Informational Note: Directories of electrical construction 
materials published by qualified testing laboratories 
contain many listing installation restrictions necessary to 
maintain the fire-resistive rating of assemblies where 
penetrations or openings are made. Building codes also 
contain restrictions on membrane penetrations on opposite 
sides of a fire-resistance-rated wall assembly. Anexample 
is the 600-mm (24-in.) minimumhorizontal separation 
that usually applies between boxes installed on opposite 
sides of the wall. Assistance in complying with 300.2 1 
can be found in building codes, fire resistance directories, 
and product listings.

Informational Note No. 1: Ampacities provided by this section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 
210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits and 215.2{A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders. 
Informational Note No. 2: For the allowable ampacities of Type MTW wire, see Table 13.5.1 in NFPA 79­2007, Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery. 

Selection of Ampacity. Where more than • for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used. 
Exception: Where two different ampacities apply to adjacent portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used beyond the point of transition, a distance equal to 3. 0 m (I0 ft) or I 0 percent of the circuit length figured at the higher ampacity, whichever is less. 
Informational Note: See 110.14(C) for conductor temperature limitations due to termination provisions. 

(3) Temperature Limitation of Conductors. No conductor shall be used in such a manner that its operating temperature exceeds that designated for the type of insulated conductor involved.

notes to the tables provide coordinating conductor sizes, types, allowable ampacities, ampacities, ambient temperatures, and number of associated conductors. The principal determinants of operating temperature are as follows: 
(1) 	
Ambient temperature -ambient temperature may vary along the conductor length as well as from time to time. 

(2) 	
Heat generated internally in the conductor as the result of load current flow, including fundamental and harmonic currents. 


2013 California Electrical Code 

ARTICLE 310 -CONDUCTORS FOR GENERAL WIRING 
The rate at which generated heat dissipates into the 
ambient medium. Thermal insulation that covers or 
surrounds conductors affects the rate ofheat dissipation. 

(4) 	Adjacent load-carrying conductors -adjacent conductors have the dual effect of raising the ambient temperature and Informational N 
are for use in determining conductor sizes on loads calculated in accordance with Article 220. Allowable ampacities result from consideration of one or more of the following: 

(1) 
Temperature 	compatibility with connected equipment, especially the connection points. 

(2) 	
Coordination with circuit and system overcurrent protection. 

(3) 	
Compliance with the requirements of product listings or certifications. See 110.3(B).

310.60 Conductors Rated 2001 to 35,000 Volts. 
(A) Definitions. 
Electrical Ducts. As used in Article 310, electrical ducts shall include any of the electrical conduits recognized in Chapter 3 as suitable for use underground; other raceways round in cross section, listed for underground use, and embedded in earth or concrete. 
Thermal Resistivity. As used in this Code, the heat transfer capability through a substance by conduction. It is the reciprocal of thermal conductivity and is designated Rho and expressed in the units °C-cm/watt. 
(B) 
Ampacities of Conductors Rated 2001 to 35,000 Volts. Ampacities for solid dielectric-insulated conductors shall be permitted to be determined by tables or under engineering supervision, as provided in 310.60(C) and (D). 

(1) 
Selection of Ampacity. Where more than one calculated or tabulated ampacity could apply for a given circuit length, the lowest value shall be used. 


Exception: Where two different ampacities apply to adjacent portions of a circuit, the higher ampacity shall be permitted to be used beyond the point of transition, a distance equal to 3. 0 m (10ft) or 10 percent of the circuit length -at the higher ampacity, whichever is less. 
Informational Note: See 110.40 for conductor
temperature limitations due to termination provisions. 

(C) Tables. Ampacities for conductors rated 2001 to 35,000 volts shall in Table 3 through Table 310 temperatures other than those the tables shall be 310.60(C)(4). 
Informational Note No. 1: For ampacities calculated in accordance with 310.60(B), reference IEEE 835-1994 (IPCEA Pub. No. P-46-426), Standard Power Cable Ampacity Tables, and the references therein for 
availability of all factors and constants. 
Informational Note No. 2: Ampacities provided by this 

section do not take voltage drop into consideration. See 
210.19(A), Informational Note No. 4, for branch circuits 
and 215.2(A), Informational Note No. 2, for feeders. 
Grounded Shields. Ampacities shown in ­Table 310.-Table 

and Table 310.60(C)(82) are for cable with shields grounded at one point only. Where shields are grounded at more than one point, ampacities shall be adjusted to take into consideration the heating due to shield currents. 
(2) Burial Depth of Underground Circuits. Where the burial depth of direct burial or electrical duct bank circuits is modified from the values shown in a figure or table, ampacities shall be permitted to be modified as indicated in (C)(2)(a) and (C)(2)(b). 
(a) 
Where burial depths are increased in part( s) of an electrical duct run, no decrease in ampacity of the conductors is needed, provided the total length of parts of the duct run increased in depth is less than 25 percent of the total run length. 

(b) 
Where burial depths are deeper than shown in a specific underground ampacity table or figure, an ampacity derating factor of 6 percent per 300-mm (1-ft) increase in depth for all values of rho shall be permitted. 


No rating change is needed where the burial depth is decreased. 
(3) Electrical Ducts in Figure 310.60. At locations where electrical ducts enter equipment enclosures from under ground, spacing between such ducts, as shown in Figure 310.60, shall be permitted to be reduced without requiring 
C)

the ampacity of conductors therein to be reduced.

398.15 Exposed Work. 
(A) 
Dry Locations. In dry locations, where not exposed to physical damage, conductors shall be permitted to be separately enclosed in flexible nonmetallic tubing. The tubing shall be in continuous lengths not exceeding 4.5 m (15 ft) and secured to the surface by straps at intervals not exceeding 1.4 m ( 4Y2 ft). 

(B) 
Entering Spaces Subject to Dampness, Wetness, or Corrosive Vapors. Conductors entering or leaving locations subject to dampness, wetness, or corrosive vapors shall have drip loops formed on them and shall then pass upward and inward from the outside of the buildings, or from the damp, wet, or corrosive location, through noncombustible, nonabsorbent insulating tubes. 



\_ 
Informational Note: See 230.52 for individual conductors entering buildings or other structures. 
(C) 
Exposed to Physical Damage. Conductors within 2.1 m (7 ft) from the floor shall be considered exposed to physical damage. Where open conductors cross ceiling joists and wall studs and are exposed to physical damage, they shall be protected by one of the following methods: 

(1) 	
Guard strips not less than 25 mm (1 in.) nominal in thickness and at least as high as the insulating supports, placed on each side of and close to the wiring. 

(2) 	
A substantial running board at least 13 mm (Yl in.) thick in back of the conductors with side protections. Running boards shall extend at least 25 mm (1 in.) outside the conductors, but not more than 50 mm (2 in.), and the protecting sides shall be at least 50 mm (2 in.) high and at least 25 mm (1 in.), nominal, in thickness. 

(3) 	
Boxing made in accordance with 398.15(C)(1) or (C)(2) and furnished with a cover kept at least 25 mm (1 in.) away from the conductors within. Where protecting vertical conductors on side walls, the boxing shall be closed at the top and the holes through which the conductors pass shall be bushed. 

(
4) 	Rigid metal conduit, intermediate metal conduit, rigid nonmetallic conduit, orelectrical metallic tubing. When installed in metal piping, the conductors shall be encased in .continuous lengths of approved flexible tubing. 


398.17 Through or Parallel to Framing Members. 
Open conductors shall be separated from contact with walls, floors, wood cross members, or partitions through which they pass by tubes or bushings of noncombustible, nonabsorbent insulating material. Where the bushing is shorter than the hole, a waterproof sleeve of noninductive material shall be inserted in the hole and an insulating bushing slipped into the sleeve at each end in such a manner as to keep the conductors absolutely out of contact with the sleeve. Each conductor shall be carried through a separate tube or sleeve. 
Informational Note: See 310.15(A)(3) for temperature 
limitation of conductors. 
2013 California Electrical Code 

398.19 Clearances. Open conductors shall be separated at least 50 mm (2 in.) from metal raceways, piping, or other conducting material, and from any exposed lighting, power, or signaling conductor, or shall be separated therefrom by a continuous and firmly fixed nonconductor in addition to the insulation of the conductor. Where any insulating tube is used, it shall be secured at the ends. Where practicable, conductors shall pass over rather than under any piping subject to leakage or accumulations of moisture. 
398.23 In Accessible Attics. Conductors in unfinished attics and roof spaces shall comply with 398.23(A) or (B). 
(A) 	Accessible by Stairway or Permanent Ladder. 
Conductors shall be installed along the side of or through bored holes in floor joists, studs, or rafters. Where run through bored holes, conductors in the joists and in studs or rafters to a height of not less than 2.1 m (7 ft) above the floor or floor joists shall be protected by substantial running boards extending not less than 25 mm (1 in.) on each side of the conductors. Running boards shall be securely fastened in place. Running boards and guard strips shall not be required for conductors installed along the sides of joists, studs, or rafters. 
(B) Not Accessible by Stairway or Permanent Ladder. 
Conductors shall be installed along the sides of or through bored holes in floor joists, studs, or rafters. 
Exception: In buildings completed before the wiring is installed, in attic and roof spaces that are not accessible by stairway or permanent ladder and have headroom at all points less than 900 mm (3ft), the wiring shall be permitted to be installed on the edges of rafters or joists facing the attic or roof space. 
398.30 Securing and Supporting. 
(A) 
Conductor Sizes Smaller Than 8 A WG. Conductors smaller than 8 AWG shall be rigidly supported on noncombustible, nonabsorbent insulating materials and shall not contact any other objects. Supports shall be installed as follows: 

(1) 	
Within 150 mm (6 in.) from a tap or splice 

(2) 	
Within 300 rilm (12 in.) of a dead-end connection to a lampholder or receptacle 

(3) 	
At intervals not exceeding 1.4 m (4Y2 ft) and at closer intervals sufficient to provide adequate support where likely to be disturbed 


(B) 
Conductor Sizes 8 A WG and Larger. Supports for conductors 8 A WG or larger installed across open spaces shall be permitted up to 4.5 m (15 ft) apart if r10ncombustible, nonabsorbent insulating spacers are used at least every 1.4 m ( 4Y2 ft) to maintain at least 65 mm (2Y2 in.) between conductors.

(A) 
General Motor Applications. For general motor applications, current ratings shall be determined based on (A)(l) and (A)(2). 

(1) 
Table Values. Other than for motors built for low speeds (less than 1200 RPM) or high torques, and for multispeed motors, the values given in Table 430.247, Table 430.248, Table 430.249, and Table 430.250 shall be used to determine the ampacity of conductors or ampere ratings of switches, branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection, instead of the actual current rating marked on the motor nameplate. Where a motor is marked in amperes, but not horsepower, the horsepower rating shall be assumed to be that corresponding to the value given in Table 430.247, Table 430.248, Table 430.249, and Table 430.250, interpolated if necessary. Motors built for low speeds (less than 1200 RPM) or high torques may have higher full-load currents, and multispeed motors will have full-load current varying

with speed, in which case the nameplate current ratings shall be used. 
Exception No. 1: Multispeed motors shall be in accordance with 430.22i} and 430.52. 
Exception No. 2: For equipment that employs a shaded­pole or permanent-split capacitor-type fan or blower motor that is marked with the motor type, the full load current for such motor marked on the nameplate of the equipment in which the fan or blower motor is employed shall be used instead of the horsepower rating to determine the ampacity or rating of the disconnecting means, the branch-circuit conductors, the controller, the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection, and the separate overload protection. This marking on the equipment nameplate shall not be less than the current marked on the fan or blower motor nameplate. 
Exception No. 3: For a listed motor-operated appliance that is marked with both motor horsepower and full-load current, the motor full-load current marked on the nameplate of the appliance shall be used instead of the horsepower rating on the appliance nameplate to determine the ampacity or rating of the disconnecting means, the branch-circuit conductors, the controller, the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection, and any separate overload protection. 
(2) 
Nameplate Values. Separate motor overload protection shall be based on the motor nameplate current rating. 

(B) 
Torque Motors. For torque motors, the rated current shall be locked-rotor current, and this nameplate current shall be used to determine the ampacity of the branch­circuit conductors covered in 430.22 and 430.24, the ampere rating of the motor overload protection, and the ampere rating of motor branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection in accordance with 430.52(B).

ARTICLE 430 -MOTORS, MOTOR CIRCUITS, AND CONTROLLERS 
Informational Note: The relationship between motor current and motor temperature changes when the motor is operated by an adjustable speed drive. In certain applications, overheating of motors can occur when operated at reduced speed, even at current levels less than a motor's rated full-load current. The overheating can be the result of reduced motor cooling when its shaft-mounted fan is operating less than rated nameplate RPM. As part of the analysis to determine whether overheating will occur, it is necessary to consider the continuous torque capability curves for the motor given the application requirements. This will assist in determining whether the motor overload protection will be able, on its own, to provide protection against overheating. These overheating protection requirements are only intended to apply to applications where an adjustable speed drive, as defined in 430.2, is used. 
For motors that utilize external forced air or liquid cooling systems, overtemperature can occur if the cooling system is not operating. Although this issue is not unique to adjustable speed applications, externally cooled motors are most often encountered with such applications. In these instances, overtemperature protection using direct temperature sensing is recommended [i.e., 430.126(A)(l), (A)(3), or (A)(4)], or additional means should be provided to ensure that the cooling system is operating (flow or pressure sensing, interlocking of adjustable speed drive system and cooling system, etc.). 

(B)

430.112, Exception. The motors shall be permitted to be located remotely from each other. 
ll. Disconnecting Means 
440.11 General. The provisions of Part II are intended to require disconnecting means capable of disconnecting air­conditioning and refrigerating equipment, including motor-compressors and controllers from the circuit conductors. 
440.12 Rating and Interrupting Capacity. 
(A) 
Hermetic Refrigerant Motor-Compressor. A disconnecting means serving a hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor shall be selected on the basis of the nameplate rated-load current or branch-circuit selection current, whichever is greater, and locked-rotor current, respectively, of the motor-compressor as follows. 

(1) 
Ampere Rating. The ampere rating shall be at least 115 percent ofthe nameplate rated-load current or branch­circuit selection current, whichever is greater. 


Exception: A listed unfosed motor circuit switch, without .fuseholders, having a horsepower rating not less than the equivalent horsepower determined in accordance with 
440.12(A)(2) shall be permitted to have an ampere rating less than 115 percent of the specified current. 
(2) Equivalent Horsepower. To determine the equivalent horsepower in complying with the requirements of 
430.109, the horsepower rating shall be selected from Table 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table 430.250 corresponding to the rated-load current or branch-circuit selection current, whichever is greater, and also the horsepower rating from Table 430.251(A) or Table 
430.251 (B) corresponding to the locked-rotor current. In case the nameplate rated-load current or branch-circuit selection current and locked-rotor current do not correspond to the currents shown in Table 430.248, Table 430.249, Table 430.250, Table 430.251(A), or Table 
430.251(B), the horsepower rating corresponding to the next higher value shall be selected. In case different horsepower ratings are obtained when applying these tables, a horsepower rating at least equal to the larger of the values obtained shall be selected. 
(B) Combination Loads. Where the combined load of two or more hermetic refrigerant motor-compressors or one or more hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor with other motors or loads may be simultaneous on a single disconnecting means, the rating for the disconnecting means shall be determined in accordance with 
440.12(B)(1) and (B)(2). 
(1) Horsepower Rating. The horsepower rating of the disconnecting means shall be determined from the sum of all currents, including resistance loads, at the rated-load condition and also at the locked-rotor condition. The combined rated-load current and the combined locked­rotor current so obtained shall be considered as a single motor for the purpose of this requirement as required by (1)(a) and (1)(b). 
(a) The full-load current equivalent to the horsepower rating of each motor, other than a hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor, and fan or blower motors as covered in 440.6(B) shall be selected from Table 
CJ 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table 430.250. These full­load currents shall be added to the motor-compressor rated-load current(s) or branch-circuit selection current(s), whichever is greater, and to the rating in amperes of other loads to obtain an equivalent full-load current for the combined load. 
(b) The locked-rotor current equivalent to the horsepower rating of each motor, other than a hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor, shall be selected from Table 430.251(A) or Table 430.251(B), and, for fan and blower motors of the shaded-pole or permanent split­capacitor type marked with the locked-rotor current, the marked value shall be used. The locked-rotor currents shall be added to the motor-compressor locked-rotor current(s) and to the rating in amperes of other loads to obtain an equivalent locked-rotor current for the combined load. Where two or more motors or other loads such as resistance heaters, or both, cannot be started simultaneously, appropriate combinations of locked-rotor and rated-load current or branch-circuit selection current, 
0 

whichever is greater, shall be an acceptable means of determining the equivalent locked-rotor current for the simultaneous combined load; 
Exception: Where part of the concurrent load is a resistance load and the disconnecting means is a switch rated in horsepower and amperes, the switch used shall be permitted to have a horsepower rating not less than the combined load to the motor-compressor(s) and other motor(s) at the locked-rotor condition, if the ampere rating of the switch is not less than this locked-rotor load plus the resistance load. 
(2) Full-Load Current Equivalent. The ampere rating of the disconnecting means shall be at least 11 5 percent of the sum of all currents at the rated-load condition 
(J

determined in accordance with 440.12(B)(l). 
Exception: A listed un.fused motor circuit switch, without 
.fuseholders, having a horsepower rating not less than the equivalent horsepower determined by 440.12(B)(1) shall be permitted to have an ampere rating less than 115 percent of the sum of all currents. 
(C) Small Motor-Compressors. For small motor­compressors not having the locked-rotor current marked on the nameplate, or for small motors not covered by Table 430.247, Table 430.248, Table 430.249, or Table 430.250, the locked-rotor current shall be assumed to be six times the rated-load current.

500.5 Classifications of Locations. 
(A) Classifications of Locations. Locations shall be classified depending on the properties of the flammable gas, flammable liquid-produced vapor, combustible-liquid produced vapors, combustible dusts, or fibers/flyings that may be present, and the likelihood that a flammable or combustible concentration or quantity is present Where pyrophoric materials are the only materials used or handled, these locations shall not be classified. Each room, section, or area shall be considered individually in determining its classification. 
Informational Note: Through the exercise of ingenuity in the layout of electrical installations for hazardous (classified)

( ' 	locations, it is frequently possible to locate much of the 
\___j 	equipment in a reduced level of classification or in an Informational Note: For further information regardingclassification and ventilation of areas involving ammonia, see ANSI/ASHRAE 15-1994, Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration, and ANSI/CGA G2.1-1989, Safety Requirements 
for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. 
(B) Class I Locations. Class I locations are those in which flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors are or may be present in the air in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures.

(2) 	
In which ignitible concentrations of such flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquids above their flash points may exist frequently because of repair or maintenance operations or because of leakage, or 

(3) 	
In which breakdown or faulty operation of equipment or processes might release ignitible concentrations of flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors and might also cause simultaneous failure of electrical equipment in such a way as to directly cause the electrical equipment to become a source of ignition. 


Informational Note No. 1: This classification usually includes 
the following locations: 
(1) 	
Where volatile flammable liquids or liquefied flammable gases are transferred from one container to another 

(2) 	
Interiors of spray booths and areas in the vicinity of spraying and painting operations where volatile flammable solvents are used 

(3) 	
Locations containing open tanks or vats of volatile flammable liquids 

(
4) Drying rooms or compartments for the evaporation of flammable solvents

Locations contammg fat-and oil-extraction equipment using volatile flammable solvents 

(6) 	
Portions of cleaning and dyeing plants where flammable liquids are used 

(7) 	
Gas generator rooms and other portions of gas manufacturing plants where flammable gasmay escape. 

(8) 	
Inadequately ventilated pump rooms for flammable gas or for volatile flammable liquids 


2013 California Electrical Code 

500.5 ARTICLE 500 -HAZARDOUS (CLASSIFIED) LOCATIONS, CLASSES I, II, AND III, DIVISIONS 1 AND 2 
(9) 	
The interiors of refrigerators and freezers in which volatile flammable materials are stored in open, lightly stoppered, or easily ruptured containers 

(10) 
All other locations where ignitible concentrations of flammable vapors or gases are likely to occur in the course of normal operations 


Informational Note No. 2: In some Division 1 locations, ignitible concentrations of flammable gases or vapors may be present continuously or for long periods of time. Examples include the following:

(4) 	
Inadequately ventilated areas within spraying or coating operations using volatile flammable fluids 

(5) 	
The interior of an exhaust duct that is used to vent ignitible concentrations of gases or vapors 


Experience has demonstrated the prudence of avoiding the installation of instrumentation or other electrical equipment in these particular areas altogether or where it cannot be avoided because it is essential to the process and other locations are not feasible [see 500.5(A), fuformational Note] using electrical equipment or instrumentation approved for the specific application or consisting of intrinsically safe systems as described in Article 
504. 
(2) 
Class I, Division 2. A Class I, Division 2 location is a location 

(1) 	
In which volatile flammable gases, flammable liquid­produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors are handled, processed, or used, but in which the liquids, vapors, or gases will normally be confined within closed containers or closed systems from which they can escape only in case of accidental rupture or breakdown of such containers or systems or in case of abnormal operation of equipment, or 

(2)

(3) 	
That is adjacent to a Class I, Division 1 location, and to which ignitible concentrations of flammable gases, flammable liquid-produced vapors, or combustible liquid-produced vapors above their flash points might occasionally be communicated unless such communication is prevented by adequate positive­pressure ventilation from a source of clean air and effective safeguards against ventilation failure are provided. 


Informational Note No. 1: This classification usually includes locations where volatile flammable liquids or flammable 

gases or vapors are used but that, in the judgment of the authority having jurisdiction, would become hazardous only in case of an accident or of some unusual operating condition. The quantity of flammable material that might escape in case of accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, the total area involved, and the record of the industry or business with respect to explosions or fires are allfactors that merit consideration in determining the classification and extent of each location. 
fuformational Note No. 2: Piping without valves, checks, meters, and similar devices would not ordinarily introduce a hazardous condition even though used for flammable liquids or gases. Depending on factors such as the quantity and size of the containers and ventilation, locations used for the storage of flammable liquids or liquefied or compressed gases in sealed containers may be considered either hazardous (classified) or unclassified locations. See NFPA 30-2008, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, and NFPA 58­2011, Liqu4/ed Petroleum Gas Code.

(3) 	
In which combustible dust accumulations on, in, or in the vicinity of the electrical equipment could be sufficient to interfere with the safe dissipation of heat from electrical equipment, or could be ignitible by abnormal operation or failure of electrical equipment. 


2013 California Electrical Code 

ARTICLE 500 -HAZARDOUS (CLASSIFIED) LOCATIONS, CLASSES I, II, AND III, DIVISIONS 1 AND 2 500.6 
Informational Note No. 1: The quantity of combustible dust that may be present and the adequacy of dust removal systems are factors that merit consideration in determining the classification and may result in an unclassified area. 
Informational Note No. 2: Where products such as seed are handled in a manner that produces low quantities of dust, the amount of dust deposited may not warrant classification. 
(D) Class III Locations. Class III locations are those that are hazardous because of the presence of easily ignitible fibers or 

CJ 

materials producing combustible flyings are handled, manufactured, or used, but in which such fibers/flyings are not likely to be in suspension· in the air in quantities sufficient to produce ignitible mixtures. 
Class III locations shall include those specified in 500.5(D)(1) and (D)(2). 
(1) Class III, Division 1. A Class III, Division 1 location is a location in which easily ignitible fibers/flyings are handled, manufactured, or used. 


Informational Note No. 1: Such locations usuallyinclude some parts of rayon, cotton, and other textile mills; combustible fibers/flyings manufacturing and processing plants; cotton gins and cotton-seed mills; flax-processing plants; clothing manufacturing plants; woodworking plants; and establishments and industries involving similar hazardous processes or conditions.

500.6 Material Groups. For purposes of testing, approval, and area classification, various air mixtures (not oxygen-enriched) shall be grouped in accordance with 500.6(A) and (B). 
Exception: Equipment identified for a specific gas, vapor, or dust. 
Informational Note: This grouping is based on the characteristics of the materials. Facilities are available for testing and identifying equipment for use in the various atmospheric groups. 
(A) Class I Group Classifications. Class I groups shall be according to 500.6(A)(1) through (A)(4). 
Informational Note No. 1: Informational Note Nos. 2 and 3 apply to 500.6(A). 
Informational Note No. 2: The explosion characteristics of air mixtures of gases or vapors vary with the specific material involved. For Class I locations, Groups A, B, C, and D, the classification involves determinations of maximum explosion pressure and maximum safe clearance between parts of a clamped joint in an enclosure. It is necessary, therefore, that equipment be identified not only for class but also for the specific group of the gas or vapor that will be present. 

Informational Note No. 3: Certain chemical atmospheres may have characteristics that require safeguards beyond those required for any of the Class I groups. Carbon disulfide is one of these chemicals because of its low ignition temperature (90°C) and the small jointclearance permitted to arrest its flame. 

(1) 
Group A. Acetylene. [497:3.3.5.1.1] 

(2) 
Group B. Flammable gas, flammable liquidproduced vapor, or combustible liquid-produced vapor mixed with air that may burn or explode, having either a maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) value less than or equal to 


0.45 mm or a minimum igniting current ratio (MIC ratio) less than or equal to 0.40. [497:3.3.5.1.2] 
Informational Note: A typical Class I, Group B material is hydrogen. 

Exception No. 1: Group D equipment shall be permitted to be used for atmospheres containing butadiene, provided all conduit runs into explosionproof equipment are provided with explosionproof seals installed within 450 mm (18 in.) of the enclosure.

500.7 ARTICLE 500 -HAZARDOUS (CLASSIFIED) LOCATIONS, CLASSES I, II, AND III, DIVISIONS I AND 2 
(B) 
Class II Group Classifications. Class II groups shall be in accordance with 500.6(B)(l) through (B)(3). 

(1) 
Group E. Atmospheres containing combustible metal dusts, including aluminum, magnesium, and their commercial alloys, or other combustible dusts whose particle size, abrasiveness, and conductivity present similar hazards in the . use of electrical equipment. 


[499:3 .3.4. 1] 
Informational Note: Certain metal dusts may have characteristics that require safeguards beyond those required for atmospheres containing the dusts of aluminum, magnesium, and their commercial alloys. For example, zirconium, thorium, and uranium dusts have extremely low ignition temperatures [as low as 20°C (68°F)] and minimum ignition energies lower than any material classified in any of the Class I or Class II groups.

(2) Group F. Atmospheres containing combustible carbonaceous dusts that have more than 8 percent total entrapped volatiles (see ASTM D 3175-02, Standard Test Method for Volatile Matter in the Analysis Sample for Coal and Coke, for coal and coke dusts) or that have been sensitized by other materials so that they present an explosion hazard. Coal, carbon black, charcoal, and coke dusts are examples of carbonaceous dusts. 
Informational Note: 

(3) Group G. Atmospheres containing combustible dusts not included in Group E or F, including flour, grain, wood, plastic, and chemicals. 
Informational Note No. 1: For additional information on group classification of Class II materials, see NFPA 499-2008, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas. 
Informational Note No. 2: The explosion characteristics of air mixtures of dust vary with the materials involved. For Class II locations, Groups E, F, and G, the classification involves the tightness of the joints of assembly and shaft openings to prevent the entrance of dust in the dust-ignitionproof enclosure, the blanketing effect of layers of dust on the equipment that may cause overheating, and the ignition temperature of the dust. It is necessary, therefore, that equipment be identified not only for the class but also for the specific group of dust that will be present. 
Informational Note No. 3: Certain dusts may require additional precautions due to chemical phenomena that can result in the generation of ignitible gases. See ­
National Electrical Safety Code, Section 127 A, Coal Handling Areas.

Seals in conduit and cable systems shall comply with 501.15(A) through (F). Sealing compound shall be used in Type MI cable termination fittings to exclude moisture and other fluids from the cable insUlation. 

Informational Note No. 1: Seals are provided in conduit and 
cable systems to minimize the passage of gases and vapors 
and prevent the passage of flames from one portion of the 
electrical installation to another through the conduit. Such 
communication through Type MI cable is inherently
prevented by construction of the cable. Unless specifically 
designed and tested for the purpose, conduit and cable seals 
are not intended to prevent the passage of liquids, gases, or 
vapors at a continuous pressure differential across the seal. 
Even at differences in pressure across the seal equivalent to a 
few inches of water, there may be a slow passage of gas or 
vapor through a seal and through conductors passing through 
the seal. See 501.15(E)(2). Temperature extremes and highly 
corrosive liquids and vapors can affect the ability of seals to 
perform their intended function. See 501.15(C)(2). 
Informational Note No. 2: Gas or vapor leakage and 
propagation of flames may occur through the interstices 
between the strands of standard stranded conductors larger 
than 2 A WG. Special conductor constructions, for example, 
compacted strands or sealing of the individual strands, are 
means of reducing leakage and preventing the propagation of flames.

Informational Note No. 1: Seals are provided in conduit and cable systems to minimize the passage of gases and vapors and prevent the passage of flames from one portion of the electrical installation to another through the conduit. Such communication through Type MI cable is inherently prevented by construction of the cable. Unless specifically designed and tested for the purpose, conduit and cable seals are not intended to prevent the passage of liquids, gases, or vapors at a continuous pressure differential across the seal. Even at differences in pressure across the seal equivalent to a few inches of water, there may be a slow passage of gas or vapor through a seal and through conductors passing through the seal. See 505.16(C)(2)(b). Temperature extremes and highly corrosive liquids and vapors can affect the ability of seals to perform their intended function. See 505.16(D)(2). 
Informational Note No. 2: Gas or vapor leakage and propagation of flames may occur through the interstices between the strands of standard stranded conductors larger than 2 A WG. Special conductor constructions, for example, compacted strands or sealing of the individual strands, are means of reducing leakage and preventing the propagation of flames.

(A) 
Documentation for Industrial Occupancies. Areas designated as hazardous (classified) locations shall be properly documented. This documentation shall be available to those authorized to design, instal inspect, maintain, or operate electrical equipment. 

(B) 
Reference Standards. Important information relating to topics covered in Chapter 5 are found in other publications. 


Informational Note: Itis important thatthe authority having jurisdiction be familiar with the recorded industrial experience as well as with standards of the National Fire (NFP A), . International Society . and the International Electrotechnical 
that may be of use in the classification of various locations, the determination of adequate ventilation, and the protection against static electricity and lightning hazards. 

506.5 Classification of Locations. 
(A) 
Classifications of Locations. Locations shall be classified on the basis of the properties of the combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings that may be present, and the likelihood that a combustible or combustible concentration or quantity is present. Each room, section, or area shall be considered individually in determining its classification. Where pyrophoric materials are the only materials used or handled, these locations are outside of the scope of this article. 

(B) 
Zone 20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 Locations. Zone 20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 locations are those in which combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings are or may be present in the air or in layers, in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures. Zone 20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 locations shall include those specified in 506.5(B)(l), (B)(2), and (B)(3). 


Informational Note: Through the exercise of ingenuity in the layout of electrical installations for hazardous (classified) locations, it is frequently possible to locate much of the equipment in a reduced level of classification and, thus, to reduce the amount of special equipment required. 

(1) 
Zone 20. A Zone 20 location is a location in which 

(a) 
lgnitible concentrations of combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings are present continuously. 

(b) 
lgnitible concentrations of combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings are present for long periods of time. 


Zone 20 locations, refer 
Electrical Apparatus in 
and Zone 22 Hazardous (Classified) Locations ­
Classification 20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 Hazardous 
(Classified) 
Informational Note No. 2: Zone 20 classification includes locations inside dust containment systems; hoppers, silos, etc., cyclones and filters, dust transport systems, except 

70-414 
some parts of belt and chain conveyors, etc.;blenders, 
mills, dryers, bagging equipment, etc. 

(2) 
Zone 21. A Zone 2l location is a location 

(a) 
In which ignitible concentrations of combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings are likely to exist occasionally under normal operating conditions; or 

(b) 
In which ignitible concentrations of combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings may exist frequently because 

of repair or maintenance operations or because ofleakage; or 

(c) 
In which equipment is operated or processes are carried on, of such a nature that equipment breakdown or faulty operations could result in the release of ignitible concentrations of combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings and also cause simultaneous failure of electrical equipment in a mode to cause the electrical equipment to become a source of ignition; or 

(d) 
That is adjacent to a Zone 20 location from which ignitible concentrations of dust or ignitible fibers/flyings could be communicated, unless communication is prevented by adequate positive pressure ventilation from a source of clean air and effective safeguards against ventilation failure are provided. 


Informational Note No. 
Zone 21 locations, refer to 

-Electrical Apparatus in 
and Zone 22 Hazardous (Classified) Locations ­
Classification Zone 20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 Hazardous 
(Classified) 
e

Informational Note No. 2: This classification usually 
includes locations outside dust containment and in the 
immediate vicinity of access doors subject to frequent 
removal or opening for operation purposes when internal 
combustible mixtures are present; locations outside dust 
containment in the proximity of filling and emptying points, 
feed belts, sampling points, truck dump stations, belt dump 
over points, etc. where no measures are employed to 
prevent the formation of combustible mixtures; locations 
outside dust containment where dust accumulates and 
where due to process operations the dust layer is likely to be 
disturbed and form combustible mixtures; locations inside 
dust containment where explosive dust clouds are likely to 
occur (but neither continuously, nor for long periods, nor 
frequently) as, for example, silos (if filled and/or emptied 
only occasionally) and the dirty side of filters if large self­
cleaning intervals are occurring. 

(3) 
Zone 22. A Zone 22 location is a location 

(a) 
In which ignitible concentrations of combustible dust or ignitible fibers/flyings are not likely to occur in normal operation and, if they do occur, will only persist for a short period; or 

(b) 
In which combustible dust or fibers/flyings are handled, processed, or used but in which the dust or fibers/flyings are normally confined within closed containers of closed systems from which they can escape only as a result of the abnormal operation of the equipment with which the dust or fibers/flyings are handled, processed, or used; or

Electrical Apparatus Use in Zone 20, Zone 21, and Zone 22 Hazardous (Classified) Locations -Classification of 21, and Zone 22 Hazardous (Classified) 
Informational Note No. 2: Zone 22 locations usually 
include outlets from bag filter vents, because in the 
event of a malfunction there can be emission of 
combustible mixtures; locations near equipment that has 
to be opened at infrequent intervals or equipment that 
from experience can easily form leaks where, due to 
pressure above atmospheric, dust will blow out; 
pneumatic equipment, flexible connections that can 
become damaged, etc.; storage locations for bags 
containing dusty product, since failure of bags can occur 
during handling, causing dust leakage; and locations 
where controllable dust layers are formed that are likely 
to be raised into explosive dust-air mixtures. Only if the 
layer is removed by cleaning before hazardous dust-air 
mixtures can be formed is the area designated 
Informational Note No. 3: Locations that normally are classified as Zone 21 can fall into Zone 22 when measures are employed to prevent the formation of explosive dust-air mixtures. Such measures include exhaust ventilation. The measures should be used in the vicinity of (bag) filling and emptying points, feed belts, sampling points, truck dump stations, belt dump over points, etc. 
506.6 Special Precaution. Article 506 requires equipment construction and installation that ensures safe performance under conditions of proper use and maintenance. 
Informational Note: It is important that inspection authorities and users exercise more than ordinary care with regard to the installation and maintenance of electrical equipment in hazardous (classified) locations. 
(A) Implementation of Zone Classification System. 
Classification of areas, engineering and design, selection of equipment and wiring methods, installation, and inspection shall be performed by qualified persons. 
(B) Dual Classification. In instances of areas within the same facility classified separately, Zone 22 locations shall be permitted to abut, but not overlap, Class II or Class III, Division 2 locations. Zone 20 or Zone 21 locations shall not abut Class II or Class III, Division 1 or Division 2 locations. 

provided that all of the space that is classified because of a single combustible dust or ignitible fiber/flying source is reclassified under the requirements of this article. 
(D) Simultaneous Presence of Flammable Gases and Combustible Dusts or Fibers/Flyings. Where flammable gases, combustible dusts, or fibers/flyings are or may be present at the same time, the simultaneous presence shall be considered during the selection and installation of the electrical equipment and the wiring methods, including the determination of the safe operating temperature of the electrical equipment. 
506.8 Protection Techniques. Acceptable protection techniques for electrical and electronic equipment in hazardous (classified) locations shall be as described in 506.8(A) through (J).

517.11 General Installation -Construction Criteria. 
The purpose of this article is to specify the installation criteria and wiring methods that minimize electrical hazards by the maintenance of adequately low potential differences only between exposed conductive surfaces that are likely to become energized and could be contacted by a patient 
Informational Note: In a health care facility, it is difficult to 
prevent the occurrence of a conductive or capacitive path 
from the patient's body to some grounded object, because 
that 	path may be established accidentally or through
instrumentation directly connected to the patient. Other 
electrically conductive surfaces that maymake an 
additional contact with the patient, or instruments that may 
be connected to the patient, then become possible sources 
of electric currents that can traverse the patient's body. The 
hazard is increased as more apparatus is associated with the 
patient, and, therefore, more intensive precautions are 
needed. Control of electric shock hazard requires the 
limitation of electric current that might flow in an electrical 
circuit involving the patient's body by raising the resistance 
of the conductive circuit that includes the patient, or by 
insulating exposed surfaces that might become energized, in 
addition to reducing the potential difference that can appear
between exposed conductive surfaces in the patient care 
vicinity, or by combinations of these methods. A special
problem is presented by the patient with an externalized 
direct conductive path to the heart muscle. The patient may 
be electrocuted at current levels so low that additional 
protection in the design of appliances, insulation of the 
\
catheter, and control of medical practice is required.

CJ 

or maintained while energized. 
(D) Low Voltage. Uninsulated parts are at a voltage not greater than 30 volts rms, 42 volts peak, or 60 volts de. 
IT. Conductors 
620.11 Insulation of Conductors. The insulation of conductors shall comply with 620.11(A) through (D). 
Informational Note: One method of determining that 
conductors are flame retardant is by testing the conductors 
to the VW-1 (Vertical-Wire) Flame Test in ANSIIUL 1581­2001, Reference Standardfor Electrical Wires, Cables, and 
Flexible Cords. 


(A) 
Hoistway Door Interlock Wiring. The conductors to the hoistway door interlocks from the hoistway riser shall be flame retardant and suitable for a temperature of not less than 200°C (392°F). Conductors shall be Type SF or equivalent.

() 

Conductors shall be Type MTW, TF, TFF, TFN, TFFN, THHN, THW, THWN, TW, XHHW, hoistway cable, or any other conductor with insulation designated as flame retardant. Shielded conductors shall be permitted if such conductors are insulated for the maximum nominal circuit voltage applied to any conductor within the cable or raceway system. 
(D) Insulation. All conductors shall have an insulation voltage rating equal to at least the maximum nominal circuit voltage applied to any conductor within the enclosure, cable, or raceway. Insulations and outer coverings that are marked for limited smoke and are so listed shall be permitted. 
620.12 Minimum Size of Conductors. The minimum size of conductors, other than conductors that form an integral part of control equipment, shall be in accordance with 
620.12(A) and (B). 
(A) Traveling Cables.

620.13 Feeder and Branch-Circuit Conductors. 
Conductors shall have an ampacity in accordance with 
620.13(A) through (D). With generator field control, the conductor ampacity shall be based on the nameplate current rating of the driving motor of the motor-generator set that supplies power to the elevator motor. 
Informational Note No. 1: The heating of conductors depends on root-mean-square current values, which, with generator field control, are reflected by the nameplate current rating of the motor-generator driving motor rather than by the rating of the elevator motor, which represents actual but short-time and intermittent full-load current values. 
Informational Note No. 2: See Figure 620.13. 
(A) Conductors Supplying Single Motor. Conductors supplying a single motor shall have an ampacity not less than the percentage of motor nameplate current determined from 430.22{!) and (E). 
Informational Note: Elevator motor currents, or those of similar functions, may exceed the nameplate value, but because they are inherently intermittent .duty and the heating of the motor and conductors is dependent on the root-mean-square (rms) current value, conductors are sized for duty cycle service as shown in Table 430.22(E). 
(B) Conductors Supplying a Single Motor Controller. 
Conductors supplying a single motor controller shall have an ampacity not less than the motor controller nameplate current

of the tray in the "ULFlame Exposure, Vertical Tray Flame 

0 	Test" in UL1685-2000, Standard for Safoty for Vertical­Tray Fire-Propagation and Smoke-Release Test for Electrical and Optical-Fiber Cables. The smokemeasurements in the test method are not applicable. 
Another method of defining resistant to the spread of.fire is 
for the damage (char length) not to exceed 1.5 m (4ft 11 
() in.) when performing the CSA "Vertical Flame Test ­
Cables in Cable Trays," as described in CSA C22.2 No. 
0.3-M-2001, Test Methods for Electrical Wires and Cables. 

(D) Type CATVX. Type CATVX limited-use community antenna television coaxial cables shall be listed as being suitable for use in dwellings and for use in raceway and shall also be listed as being resistant to flame spread. 
Informational Note: One method of determining that cable 
is resistant to flame spread is by testing the cable to the 
VW-1 (vertical-wire) flame test in ANSJIUL 1581-2001, 
Reference Standard for Electrical Wires, Cables and Flexible Cords.

Informational Note No. 1: Table 1 is based on common 
conditions of proper cabling and alignment of conductors 
where the length of the pull and the number of bends are 
within reasonable limits. It should be recognized that, for 
certain conditions, a larger size conduit or a lesser conduit 
filshould be considered. 
Informational Note No. 2: When pulling three conductors 

or cables into a raceway, if the ratio of the raceway (inside 
diameter) to the conductor or cable (outside diameter) is 
between 2.8 and 3.2, jamming can occur. While jamming 
can occur when pulling four or more conductors or cables 
into a raceway, the probability is very low. 
Notes to Tables 
(1) 	
See III!IIIIIII Annex C for the maximum number of conductors and fixtur wires, all of the same size (total cross-sectional area including insulation) permitted in trade sizes of the applicable conduit or tubing. 

(2) 
Table 1 applies only to complete conduit or tubing sys­tems and is not intended to apply to sections of conduit or tubing used to protect exposed wiring from physical damage. 

(3) 
Equipment grounding or bonding conductors, where in­stalled, shall be included when calculating conduit or tub-


Table 2 Radius of Conduit and Tubing Bends 
ing fill The actual dimensions of the equipment ground­
ing or bonding conductor (insulated or bare) shall be used 
in the calculation. 

(4) 
Where conduit 	or tubing nipples having a maximum length not to exceed 600 mm (24 in.) are installed be­tween boxes, cabinets, and similar enclosures, the nipples shall be permitted to be fille to 60 percent of their total cross-sectional area, and 310.15(B)II(a) ad­justment factors need not apply to this condition. 

(5) 
For conductors not included in Chapter 9, such as mul­ticonductor cables the actual dimensions shall be used. 

(6) 
For combinations of conductors of different sizes, 	use Table 5 and Table 5A for dimensions of conductors and Table 4 for the applicable conduit or tubing dimensions. 

(7) 	
When calculating the maximum number of conductors permitted in a conduit or tubing, all of the same size (total cross-sectional area including insulation), the next higher whole number shall be used to determine the maximum number of conductors permitted when the calculation results in a decimal of 0.8 or larger. 

(8) 
Where bare conductors are permitted by other sections of this Code, the dimensions for bare conductors in Table 8 shall be permitted. 

(9) 
A multiconductor cable or flexibl 	cord of two or more conductors shall be treated as a single conductor for calculating percentage conduit fi1 area. For cables that have elliptical cross sections, the cross-sectional area calculation shall be based on using the major diameter of the ellipse as a circle diameter.

Notes: 

1. 
These resistance values are valid only for the parameters as given. Using conductors having coated strands, different stranding type, and, especially, other temperatures changes the resistance. 

2. 





for temperature change: R2 = R1 [1 + a (T2 -75)] where acu = 0.00323, aAL = 0.00330 at 75°C. 
3. 
Conductors with compact and compressed stranding have about 9percent and 3 percent, respectively, smaller bare conductor diameters than those shown. See Table SA for actual compact cable dimensions. 

4. 
The lACS conductivities used: bare copper = 100%, aluminum = 61%. 


5. 
Class B stranding is listed as well as solid for some sizes. Its overall diameter and area is that of its circumscribing circle.

Notes: 

1. 
These values are based on the following constants: UL-Type Rllllwires with Class B stranding, in cradled conf gu­ration. Wire conductivities are 100 percent lACS copper and 61 percent lACS aluminum, and aluminum conduit is 45 percent lACS. Capacitive reactance is ignored, since it is negligible at these voltages. These resistance values are valid only at 75°C (167"F) and for the parameters as given, but are representative for 600-volt wire types operating at 60 Hz. 

2. 
Effective Z is define as R cos(9) + X sin(9), where 9 is the power factor angle of the circuit. Multiplying current by effective impedce gives a good approximation for line-to-neutral voltage drop. Effective impedance values shown in this table are valid only at 0.85 power factor. For another circuit power factor (PF), effective impedance 


0 
(Ze) can be calculated from R and XL values given in this table as follows: Ze=R x PF +XL sin[arccos(PF)].

-Annex B Application Information for Ampacity Calculation () 
This informative annex is not a part of the requirements of 
this NFPA document but is included for informational pur­poses only. 
B.310.15(B)(l) Application Information. This informative annex provides application information for am­pacities calculated under engineering supervision. 
B.310.15(B)(2) Typical Applications Covered by Tables. 
Typical ampacities for conductors rated 0 through 2000 volts are shown in Table B.310. through Table 
B.3 10.1111J1111111. Table B.310. 
Under­ground electrical duct bank configurations as detailed in Fig­ure B.310.IIIJIIIII, Figure B.310.11SIIIIJ, and Figure 
B.31 O.IIJIIIII, are utilized for conductors rated 0 through 5000 volts. In Figure B.310.IBBIIIIEI through Figure 
B.3 10., where adjacent duct banks are used, a separation of 1.5 m ( 5 ft) between the centerlines of the closest ducts in each bank or 1.2 m (4 ft) between the extremities of the concrete envelopes is sufficient to prevent derating of the conductors due to mutual heating. These ampacities were cal­culated as detailed in the basic ampacity paper, AlEE Paper 57-660, The Calculation of the Temperature Rise and Load Capability of Cable Systems, by J. H. Neher and M. H. McGrath. For additional information concerning the applica­tion of these ampacities, see IEEE/ICEA Standard S-135/P­46-426, Power Cable Ampacities, and IEEE Standard 835­1994, Standard Power Cable Ampacity Tables. 
Typical values of thermal resistivity (Rho) are as follows: 
Average soil (90 percent of USA) = 90 
Concrete = 55 
Damp soil (coastal areas, high water table) = 60 
Paper insulation = 550 
Polyethylene (PE) = 450 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) = 650 
Rubber and rubber-like = 500 
Very dry soil (rocky or sandy) = 120 

Thermal resistivity, as used in this informative annex, refers to the heat transfer capability through a substance by conduction. It is the reciprocal of thermal conductivity and is normally expressed in the units°C-cm/watt. For addi­tional information on determining soil thermal resistivity (Rho), see ANSI/IEEE Standard 442-1996, Guide for Soil Thermal Resistivity Measurements. 
B.310.15(B)(3) Criteria Modifications Where values of load factor and Rho are known for a particular electrical duct bank installation and they are different from those shown in a specifi table or figure the ampacities shown in the table or figur can be modifie by the application of factors derived from the use of Figure B.31 0 ........ 
Where two different ampacities apply to adjacent por­tions of a circuit, the higher ampacity can be used beyond 
C)the point of transition, a distance equal to 3 m(10 ft) or 1 0 percent of the circuit length at the higher ampacity, whichever is less. 
Where the burial depth of direct burial or electrical duct bank circuits are modifie from the values shown in a fig ure or table, ampacities can be modifie as shown in (a) and 
(b) 
as follows. 

(a) 
Where burial depths are increased in part(s) of an electrical duct run to avoid underground obstructions, no de­crease in ampacity of the conductors is needed, provided the total length of parts of the duct run increased in depth to avoid obstructions is less than 25 percent of the total run length. 

(b) 
Where burial depths are deeper than shown in a specifi underground ampacity table or figure an ampacity derating factor of 6 percent per increased 300 mm(foot) of depth for all values of Rho can be utilized. No rating change is needed where the burial depth is decreased.

B.310.15(B)(4) Electrical Ducts. The term electrical duct(s) is define in 310.60. 
B.310.15(B)(5) Table B.310.IIIlllllll and Table 
B.310.-. 
(a) 
To obtain the ampacity of cables installed in two electrical ducts in one horizontal row with 190-mm (7.5­in.) center-to-center spacing between electrical ducts, simi­lar to Figure B.310.11111111, Detail I, multiply the am­pacity shown for one duct in Table B.310.1111!111111 and Table B.310.I!IIIIJiaB by 0.88. 

(b) 
To obtain the ampacity of cables installed in four electrical ducts in one horizontal row with 190-mm (7.5-in.) center-to-center spacing between electrical ducts, similar to Figure B.310.!111111, Detail 2, multiply the ampacity shown for three electrical ducts in Table B.310. and Table B.310.IIIIJIJIIIII by 0.94. 


B.310.15(B)(6) Electrical Ducts Used in Figure B.310..'1J11t1J· If spacing between electrical ducts, as shown in Figure B.310.IJI'IIIIIfa, is less than speci­fie in Figure B.31 where electrical ducts enter equipment enclosures from underground, the am­pacity of conductors contained within such electrical ducts need not be reduced.

B.310.15(B)(7) Examples Showing Use of Figure for Rho= 120 and LF = 100,12 = 400. The ratio Jzf/1 = 0.686. 
B.310.IIIJIIIIIll for Electrical Duct Bank Ampacity 	Locate Rho = 90 at the bottom of the chart and follow the 90 Rho line to the intersection with 100 percent load factor where 
() 
Modifications Figure B.310.--is used for inter­the equivalent Rho = 90. Then follow the 90 Rho line to polation or extrapolation for values of Rho and load factor !z111ratio of 0.686 where F = 0.74. The desired ampacity =for cables installed in electrical ducts. The upper family of 
curves shows the variation in ampacity and Rho at unity load factor in terms of /1 , the ampacity for Rho = 60, and 50 percent load factor. Each curve is designated for a par­ticular ratio Jzf/1, where /2 is the ampacity at Rho= 120 and 100 percent load factor. 
The lower family of curves shows the relationship be­tween Rho and load factor that will give substantially the same ampacity as the indicated value of Rho at 1 00 percent load factor. 
As an example, to fin the ampacity of a 500-kcmil copper cable circuit for six electrical ducts as shown in Table B.310.1!111J111: At the Rho= 60, LF =50, /1 = 583; 0.74 x 583 = 431, which agrees with the table for Rho = 90, LF = 100. 

To determine the ampacity for the same circuit where Rho = 80 and LF = 75, using Figure B.310.1111111, the equivalent Rho = 43, F = 0.855, and the desired ampacity = 
0.855 x 583 = 498 amperes. Values for using Figure 
B.310.IJIIIall are found in the electrical duct bank am­pacity tables of this informative annex. 
Where the load factor is less than 1 00 percent and can be verifie by measurement or calculation, the ampacity of electrical duct bank installations can be modifie as shown. Different values of Rho can be accommodated in the same manner.

Notes: 

1. 
This table is for concentric stranded conductors only. For compact stranded conductors, Table C.4(A) should be used. 

2. 
Two-hour fire-rate Rillicable has ceramiflabl insulation which has much larger diameters than other RHH wires. Consult manufacturer's conduit filtables. 


* 'IyPes Rllli, RHW, and RHW-2 without outer covering. 










Definition Compact stranding is the result of a manufacturing process where the standard conductor is compressed to the extent that interstices (voids between strand wires) are virtually eliminated.

Notes: 
1. 
This table is for concentric stranded conductors only. For compact stranded conductors, Table C.7(A) 
should be used. 


2. 
Two-hour fire-rate RHH cable has ceramifiabl insulation which has much larger diameters than other 
RHH wires. Consult manufacturer's conduit tiltables.

Defmition Compact stranding is the result of a manufacturing process where the standard conductor is 
compressed to the extent that the interstices (voids between strand wires) are virtually eliminated. 
2013 California Electrical Code 

-Annex D Examples 
This informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only. 
Selection of Conductors. In the following examples, the results are generally expressed in amperes (A). To select conductor sizes, refer to the 0 through 2000 volt (V) ampacity tables of Article 310 and the rules of 
310.15 that pertain to these tables. 
Voltage. For uniform application of Articles 210, 215, and 220, a nominal voltage of 120, 120/240, 240, and 208¥/120 Vis used in calcu­lating the ampere load on the conductor. 
Fractions of an Ampere. Except where the calculations result in a major fraction of an ampere (0.5 or larger), such fractions are permitted to be dropped. 
Power Factor. Calculations in the following examples are based, for convenience, on the assumption thatall loads have the same power factor (PF). 
Ranges. For the calculation of the range loads in these examples, Column C of Table 220.55 has been used. For optional methods, see Columns A and B of Table 220.55. Except where the calculations result in a major fraction of a kilowatt (0.5 or larger), such fractions are permitted to be dropped. 
SI Units. For metric conversions, 0.093 m2 =1 if and 0.3048 m = 1 ft. 
Example Dl(a) One-Family Dwelling 

The dwelling has a f oor area of 1500 if, exclusive of an unfnished cellar not adaptable for future use, unf nished attic, and open porches. Appliances are a 12-kW range and a 5.5-kW, 240-V dryer. Assume range and dryer kW ratings equivalent to kVA ratings in accordance with 220.54 and 220.55. 
Calculated Load [see 220.40] 
General Lighting Load 1500 if at 3 VAJff =4500 VA 
Minimum Number of Branch Circuits Required [see 210.11(A)] 
General Lighting Load: 4500 VA+ 120 V =M A 
This requires three 15-A, 2-wire or two 20-A, 2-wire circuits. 
Small-Appliance Load: Two 2-wire, 20-A circuits [see 210.JJ(C)(1)] 
Laundry Load: One 2-wire, 20-A circuit [see 210.1l(C)(2)] 
Bathroom Branch Circuit: One 2-wire, 20-A circuit (no additional load 
calculation is required for this circuit) [see 210.JJ(C)(3)] 

Minimum Size Feeder Required [see 220.40]

Example D2(a) Optional Calculation for One-Family Dwell­ing, Heating Larger Than Air Conditioning [see 220.82] 

The dwelling has a floo area of 1500 ft2,exclusive of an un:finishe cellar not adaptable for future use, unfinishe attic, and open porches. It has a 12-kW range, a 2.5-kW water heater, a 1.2-kW dishwasher, 9 kW of electric space heating installed in fiv rooms, a 5-kW clothes dryer, and a 6-A, 230-V, room air-conditioning unit. Assume range, water heater, dish­washer, space heating, and clothes dryer kW ratings equivalent to kVA. 
Air Conditioner kVA Calculation 
6 A X 230 v + 1000 =1.38 kVA 

This 1.38 kVA [item 1 from 220.82(C)] is less than 40% of 9 kVA of separately controlled electric heat [item 6 from 220.82(C)], so the 1.38 kVA need not be included in the service calculation.

A store 50 ft by 60 ft, or 3000 ff, has 30 ftof show window. There are a total of 80 duplex receptacles. The service is 120/240 V, single phase 3-wire service. Actual connected lighting load is 8SOO VA.

*In the example, 12S% of the actual connected lighting load (8SOO VA x 1.2S = 10,625 VA) is less than 125% of the load from Table 220.12, so the minimum lighting load from Table 220.12 is used in the calculation. Had the actual lighting load been greater than the value calculated from Table 220.12, 12S% of the actual connected lighting load would have been used. 
Minimum Number of Branch Circuits Required 
General Lighting: Branch circuits need only be installed to supply the actual connected load [see 210.ll(B)]. 
8SOO VA X 1.2S = 10,62S VA 
10,62S VA + 240 V = 44 A for 3-wire, 120/240 V 


The lighting load would be permitted to be served by 2-wire or 3-wire, IS-or 20-A circuits with combined capacity equal to 44 A or greater for 3-wire circuits or 88 A or greater for 2-wire circuits. The feeder capacity as well as the number of branch-circuit positions available for lighting circuits in the panelboard must reflec the full calculated load of 9000 VA X 1.2S = 11,2SO VA.

The show window lighting is permitted to be served by 2-wire or 3-wire circuits with a capacity equal to 31 A or greater for 3-wire circuits or 62 A or greater for 2-wire circuits.

Example D3(a) Industrial Feeders in a Common Raceway 

Anindustrial multi-building facility has its service at the rear of its main building, and then provides 480Y/277-volt feeders to additional buildings behind the main building in order to segregate certain processes. The facility supplies its remote buildings through a partially enclosed access corridor that extends from the main switchboard rearward along a path that provides convenient access to services within 1S m (50 ft) of each additional building supplied. Two building feeders share a common race­way for approximately 4S m (1SO ft) and run in the access corridor along with process steam and control and communications cabling. The steam ()··raises the ambient temperature around the power raceway to as much as 3S°C. At a tee fitting the individual building feeders then run to each of the two buildings involved. The feeder neutrals are not connected to the equipment grounding conductors in the remote buildings. All distribution equipment terminations are listed as being suitable for 7S°C connections. 
Each of the two buildings has the following loads: 
Lighting, 11,600 VA, comprised of electric-discharge luminaires con­
nected at 277 V 

Receptacles, 22 12S-volt, 20-ampere receptacles on general-purpose branch circuits, supplied by separately derived systems in each of the buildings

Where the overcurrent protective device and its assembly are listed for operation at 100 percent of its rating, a 125 ampere overcurrent protective device would be permitted. However, overcurrent protective device assem­blies listed for 100 percent of their rating are typically not available at the 125-ampere rating. (See 215.3 Exception.) 
Ungrounded Feeder Conductors 
The conductors must independently meet requirements for (1) termina­tions, and (2) conditions of use throughout the raceway run. Minimum size conductor at the overcurrrent device termination 
[see 110.14(C) and 215.2(A)(1), using 75°C ampacity column in Table 
310. 110 AWG. 
Minimum size conductors in the raceway based on actual load [see Article 100, Ampacity, and 310.15(B)(I)(a) and correction factors to Table 
99,000 VA I0.1 I0.96 = 147,000 VA 
[70% = 310.15{B){I)(a)] & [0.96 = Correction factors to Table 

(J Conversion to amperes: 147,000 VA I(480V X ..J3) = 177 A 
Note that the neutral conductors are counted as current-carrying con­ductors [see 310.15(B)(IJ(c)] in this example because the discharge light­ing has substantial nonlinear content. This requires a 210 AWG conductor based on the 90°C column of Table Therefore, the worst case is given by the raceway conditions, and must be used. If the utility corridor was at normal temperatures [(30°C {86°F)], and if the lighting at each building were supplied from the local separately derived system (thus requiring no neutrals in the supply feeders) the raceway result (99,000 VA I0.8 = 124,000 VA; 124,000 VA I(480V x..J3) = 149 A, or a 1 AWG conductor @ 90°C) could not be used because the termination result (110 AWG based on the 75°C column of Table 310. would become the worst case, requiring the larger conductor. 
In every case, the overcurrent protective device shall provide overcur­rent protection for the feeder conductors in accordance with their ampacity as provided by this Code (see 240.4). A 90°C 210 AWG conductor has a Table ampacity of 195 amperes. Adjusting for the condi­tions of use (35°C ambient temperature, 8 current-carrying conductors in the common raceway), 
195 amperes x 0.96 x 0.7 = 131 A 
The 150-ampere circuit breaker protects the 210 AWG feeder conduc­tors, because 240.4(B) permits the use of the next higher standard size overcurrent protective device. Note that the feeder layout precludes the 

( \, application of 310.15(A)(2) Exception. 
\.....__/) Feeder Neutral Conductor (see 220. 61) 
Because 210.11{B) does not apply to these buildings, the load cannot be assumed to be evenly distributed across phases. Therefore the maximum im­balance must be assumed to be the full lighting load in this case, or 11,600 VA. (11,600 VA I277V = 42 amperes.) The ability of the neutral to return fault current [see 250.32(B)Exception(2)] is not a factor in thiscalcu­lation. 
Because the neutral runs between the main switchboard and the build­ing panelboard, likely terminating on a busbar at both locations, and not 
2013 California Electrical Code 

ANNEXD Annex D: Examples 
on overcurrent devices, the effects of continuous loading can be disre­garded in evaluating its terminations [see 215.2(A)(1) Exception No. 2]. That calculation is (11,600 VA + 277V) = 42 amperes, to be evaluated under the 75°C column of Table 310 The minimum size of the neutral might seem to be 8 AWG, but that siZe would not be sufficient to be depended upon in the event of a line-to-neutral short circuit [see 215.2(A)(1), second paragraph]. Therefore, since the minimum size equipment grounding conductor for a 150 ampere circuit, as covered in Table 250.122, is 6 AWG, that is the minimum neutral size required for this feeder.

Example D6 Maximum Demand for Range Loads 

Table 220.55, Column C, applies to ranges not over 12 kW. The applica­tion of Note I to ranges over 12 kW (and not over 27 kW) and Note 2 to ranges over 8'14 kW (and not over 27 kW) is illustrated in the following two examples. 
A. Ranges All the Same Rating (see Table 220.55, Note I) 
Assume 24 ranges, each rated 16 kW. From Table 220.55, Column C, the maximum demand for 24 ranges of 12-kW rating is 39 kW. 16 kW exceeds 12 kW by 4. 
5% x 4 = 20% (5% increase for each kW in excess of 12) 
39 kW x 20% = 7.8 kW increase 
39 + 7.8 = 46.8 kW (value to be used in selection of feeders) 
B. Ranges of Unequal Rating (see Table 220.55, Note 2) 
Assume 5 ranges, each rated 11 kW; 2 ranges, each rated 12 kW; 20 ranges, each rated 13.5 kW; 3 ranges, each rated 18 kW. 
5 ranges X 12 kW = 60 kW (use 
12 kW for range 

rated less than 12) 2 ranges X 12 kW = 24kW 20 ranges X 13.5 kW = 270 kW 3 ranges X 18 kW = 54kW 
30 ranges, Total kW = 408 kW 408+ 30 ranges = 13.6 kW (average to be used for calculation) 
70-810 ANNEX D 
From Table 220.55, Column C, the demand for 30 ranges of 12-kW rating is 15 kW + 30 (1 kW x 30 ranges) = 45 kW. 13.6 kW exceeds 12 kW by 1.6 kW (use 2 kW). 
5% x 2 = 10% (5% increase for each kW in excess of 12 kW) 
45 kW x 10% = 4.5 kW increase 
45 kW + 4.5 kW = 49.5 kW (value to be used in selection of feeders)

Protection (see 240.6, 430.6, 430.22, 430.23, 430.24, 430.32, 
430.52, and 430.62, Table 430.52, and 
Table 430.250) 

Determine the minimum required conductor ampacity, the motor overload protection, the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protection, and the feeder protection, for three induction-type motors on a 480-V, 3-phase feeder, as follows: 
(a) 
One 25-hp, 460-V, 3-phase, squirrel-cage motor, nameplate full­
load current 32 A, Design B, Service Factor 1.15 


(b) 
Two 30-hp, 460-V, 3-phase, wound-rotor motors, nameplate pri­
mary full-load current 38 A, nameplate secondary full-load current 65 A, 
40°C rise. 



Conductor Ampacity 
The full-load current value used to determine the minimum required con­
ductor ampacity is obtained from Table 430.250 [see 430.6(A)] for the 
squirrel-cage motor and the primary of the wound-rotor motors. To obtain 
the minimum required conductor ampacity, the full-load current is multi­
plied by 1.25 [see 430.22 and 430.23(A)]. 

For the 25-hp motor, 34 A X 1.25 = A 
For the 30-horsepower motors, 40 A X 1.25 = 50 A 
65 A X 1.25 = A 
0 

Motor Overload Protection 
Where protected by a separate overload device, the motors are required to 
have overload protection rated or set to trip at not more than 125% of the 
nameplate full-load current [see 430.6(A) and 430.32(A)(I)]. 
For the 25-hp motor, 32 A X 1.25 = 40.0 A 
For the 30-hp motors, 38 A X 1.25 = A 
Where the separate overload device is an overload relay (not a fuse or 
circuit breaker), and the overload device selected at 125% is not sufficient 
to start the motor or carry the load, the trip setting is permitted to be 
increased in accordance with 430.32(C). 
Branch-Circuit Short-Circuit and Ground-Fault Protection 
The selection of the rating of the protective device depends on the type of 
protective device selected, in accordance with 430.52 and Table 430.52. 
The following is for the 25-hp motor. 

0 

(a) 
Nontime-Delay Fuse: The fuse rating is 300% x 34 A= 102 A. The 
next larger standard fuse is 110 A [see 240.6 and 430.52(C)(I), Exception 
No. I]. If the motor will not start with a 110-A nontime-delay fuse, the 
fuse rating is permitted to be increased to 125 A because this rating does 
not exceed 400% [see 430.52(C)(I), Exception No. 2(a)]. 


(b) 
Time-Delay Fuse: The fuse rating is 175% x 34 A= 59.5 A. The 


\

next larger standard fuse is 60 A [see 240.6 and 430.52(C}(I), Exception 
No. I]. If the motor will not start with a 60-A time-delay fuse, the fuse 
rating is permitted to be increased to 70 A because this rating does not 
exceed 225% [see 430.52(C}(I), Exception No. 2(b)]. 

Feeder Short-Circuit and Ground-Fault Protection 
The rating of the feeder protective device is based on the sum of the largest branch-circuit protective device (example is 110 A) plus the sum of \ the full-load currents of the other motors, or 110 A+ 40 A+40 A = 190 
A. The nearest standard fuse that does not exceed this value is 17 5 A [see 
240. 6 and 430.62(A)].

Determine the conductor ampacity for a 460-V 3-phase, 60-Hz ac feeder supplying a group of six elevators. The 460-V ac drive motor nameplate rating of the largest MG set for one elevator is 40 hp and 52 A, and the remaining elevators each have a 30-hp, 40-A, ac drive motor rating for their MG sets. In addition to a· motor controller, each elevator has a separate motion/operation controller rated I 0 A continuous to operate mi­croprocessors, relays, power supplies, and the elevator car door operator. The MG sets are rated continuous.

Annex E: Construction Types 
Annex E 

This informative annex is not a part of the requirements of 
this NFPA document but is included for informational pur­poses only. 
Table E.l contains the fir resistance rating, in hours, for Types I through V construction. The fiv different types of construction can be summarized briefl as follows (see also Table E.2): 
Type I is a Fire-Resistive construction type. All struc­tural elements and most interior elements are required to be noncombustible. Interior, nonbearing partitions are permit­ted to be 1 or 2 hour rated. For nearly all occupancy types, Type I construction can be of unlimited height. 
ANNEX E 
Types of Construction 0 
Type II construction has 3 categories: Fire-Resistive, 
One-Hour Rated, and Non-Rated. The number of stories 
permitted for multifamily dwellings varies from two for 
Non-Rated and four for One-Hour Rated to 12 for Fire­
Resistive construction. 

0

Type ill construction has two categories: One-Hour Rated 
and Non-Rated. Both categories require the structural frame­
work and exterior walls to be of noncombustible material. 
One-Hour Rated construction requires all interior partitions to 
be one-hour rated. Non-Rated construction allows nonbearing 
interior partitions to be of non-rated construction. The maxi­

(J

mum permitted number of stories for multifamily dwellings 
and other structures is two for Non-Rated and four for One­
Hour Rated.

Type IV is a single construction category that provides 

0 
for heavy timber construction. Both the structural frame­work and the exterior walls are required to be noncombus­
tible except that wood members of certain minimum sizes are allowed. This construction type is seldom used for mul­tifamily dwellings but, if used, would be permitted to be four stories high. 

0 
Type V construction has two categories: One-Hour Rated and Non-Rated. One-Hour Rated construction re­

I. Availability and Reliability for Critical Operations Power Systems. Critical operations power systems may support facilities with a variety of objectives that are vital to public safety. Often these objectives are of such critical importance that system downtime is costly in terms of eco­nomic losses, loss of security, or loss of mission. For those reasons, the availability of the critical operations power system, the percentage of time that the system is in service, is important to those facilities. Given a specifie level of availability, the reliability and maintainability requirements are then derived based on that availability requirement. 
Availability. Availability is define as the percentage of time that a system is available to perform its function(s). Availability is measured in a variety of ways, including the following: 
A'I bT 1 Ity MTBF
:vaJ. a = 

where: MFBF =mean time between failures MTTF =mean time .to failure MTTR =mean time to repair 
See the following table for an example of how to establish required availability for critical operation power systems: 
Availability  Hours of Downtime  
0.9  876  
0.99  87.6  
0.999  8.76  
0.9999  0.876

0.999999  0.00876  
0.9999999  0.000876  

•aased on a year of 8760 hours. 
Annex F Availability and Reliability for Critical Operations Power Systems; and Development and Implementation of Functional Performance Tests (FPTs) for Critical Operations Power Systems 
Availability of a system in actual operations is deter­mined by the following: 
(1) 
The frequency of occurrence of failures. Failures may prevent the system from performing its function or may cause a degraded effect on system operation. Frequency of failures is directly related to the system's level of reliability. 

(2) 
The time required to restore operations following a sys­tem failure or the time required to perform maintenance to prevent a failure. These times are determined in part by the system's level of maintainability. 

(3) 
The logistics provided to support maintenance of the system. The number and availability of spares, mainte­nance personnel, and other logistics resources (refuel­ing, etc.) combined with the system's level of maintain­ability determine the total downtime following a system failure. 


Reliability. Reliability is concerned with the probability and frequency of failures (or lack of failures). A commonly used measure of reliability for repairable systems is MFBF. The equivalent measure for nomepairable items is MTTF. Reliability is more accurately expressed as a probability over a given duration of time, cycles, or other parameter. For example, the reliability of a power plant might be stated as · 95 percent probability of no failure over a 1 000-hour operat­ing period while generating a certain level of power. Reliabil­ity is usually define in two ways (the electrical power indus­
try has historically not used these definitions) 
(
1) The duration or probability of failure-free performance under stated conditions 

(2) 
The probability that an item can perform its intended function for a specifie interval under stated conditions [For nomedundant items, this is equivalent to the pre­ceding definitio (1). For redundant items this is equivalent to the definitio of mission reliability.] 


Maintainability. Maintainability is a measure of how quickly and economically failures can be prevented through preventive maintenance, or system operation can be re­stored following failure through corrective maintenance. A commonly used measure of maintainability in terms of cor­rective maintenance is the mean time to repair (MTTR). Maintainability is not the same thing as maintenance. It is a design parameter, while maintenance consists of actions to correct or prevent a failure event. 
Improving Availability. The appropriate methods to use for improving availability depend on whether the facility is

/"\ 
being designed or is already in use. For both cases, a reliability/availability analysis should be performed to de­termine the availability of the old system or proposed new system in order to ascertain the hours of downtime (see the preceding table). The AHJ or government agency should dictate how much downtime is acceptable. 
Existing facilities: For a facility that is being operated, two basic methods are available for improving availability when the current level of availability is unacceptable: (1) Selectively adding redundant units (e.g., generators, chill­ers, fuel supply to eliminate sources of single-point failure, and (2) optimizing maintenance using a reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) approach to minimize downtime. [Re­fer to NFPA 70B-2010, Recommended Practice for Electri­cal Equipment Maintenance.] A combination of the previ­ous two methods can also be implemented. A third very expensive method is to redesign subsystems or to replace components and subsystems with higher reliability items; [Refer to NFPA 70B.] 
New facilities: The opportunity for high availability and reliability is greatest when designing a new facility. By applying an effective reliability strategy, designing for maintainability, and ensuring that manufacturing and com­missioning do not negatively affect the inherent levels of reliability and maintainability, a highly available facility will result. The approach should be as follows: 
(1) 	
Develop and determine a reliability strategy (establish goals, develop a system model, design for reliability, conduct reliability development testing, conduct reli­ability acceptance testing, design system delivery, maintain design reliability, maintain design reliability in operation). 

(2) 	
Develop a reliability program. This is the application of the reliability strategy to a specifi system, process, or function. Each step in the preceding strategy re­quires the selection and use of specifi methods and tools. For example, various tools can be used to de­velop requirements or evaluate potential failures. To derive requirements, analytical models can be used, for example, quality function development (a technique for deriving more detailed, lower-level requirements from one level to another, beginning with mission require­ments, i.e., customer needs). This model was developed as part of the total quality management movement. Parametric models can also be used to derive design values of reliability from operational values and vice versa. Analytical methods include but are not limited to things such as thermal analysis, durability analysis, and predictions. Finally, one should evaluate possible fail­ures. A failure modes and effects criticality analysis (FMECA) and fault tree analysis (FTA) are two meth­ods for evaluating possible failures. The mission facil­ity engineer should determine which method to use or whether to use both. 


2013 California Electrical Code 
Annex F: Critical Operations Power Systems 

(3) 	IdentifY Reliability Requirements. The entire effort for designing for reliability begins with identifying the mission critical facility's reliability requirements. These requirements are stated in a variety of ways, depending on the customer and the specifi system. For a mission-critical facility, it would be the mission suc­cess probability. 
ll. Development and Implementation of Functional Per­formance Tests (FPTs) for Critical Operations Power Sys­tems Development of FPT 
(1) Submit Functional Performance Tests (FPTs). System/component tests or FPTs are developed from sub­mitted drawings, (SODs), and 
(SOMMs), in­cluding large component testing (i.e., transformers, cable, generators, UPS), and how components operate as part of the total system. The commissioning authority develops the test and cannot be the installation contractor (or subcontractor). 
As the equipment/components/systems are installed, quality assurance procedures are administered to verifY that components are installed in accordance with minimum manufacturers' recommendations, safety codes, and accept­able installation practices. Quality assurance discrepancies are then identifie and added to a "commissioning action list" that must be rectifie as paf of the commissioning program. These items would usually be discussed during commissioning meetings. Discrepancies are usually identi­fie initially by visual inspection. 
(2) 
Review FPTs. The tests must be reviewed by the cus­tomer, electrical contractors, quality assurance personnel, maintenance personnel, and other key personnel (the commis­sioning team). Areas of concern include, among others, all functions of the system being tested, all major components included, whether the tests reflec the system operating docu­ments, and verificatio that the tests make sense. 

(3) 
Make Changes to FPTs as Required. The commis­sioning authority then implements the corrections, ques­tions answered, and additions. 

(
4) FPTs Approval. After the changes are made to the FPTs, they are submitted to the commissioning team. When it is acceptable, the customer or the designated approval authority approves the FPTs. It should be noted that even though the FPT is approved, problems that arise during the test (or areas not covered) must be addressed. 

Testing Implementation for FPTs. The fina step in the successful commissioning plan is testing and proper execution of system-integrated tests. 

(1) 
Systems Ready to Operate. The FPTs can be implemented as various systems become operative (i.e., test for the generator system) or when the entire system is in­stalled. However, the fina "pull the plug" test is performed only after all systems are completely installed. If the elec­trical contractor (or subcontractor) implements the FPTs, a 


70-8 17 

witness must initial each step of the test. The electrical contractor cannot employ the witness directly or indirectly. 
(2) Perform Tests (FPTs). If the system fails the test, the problem must be resolved and the equipment or system re­tested or the testing requirements re-analyzed until successful tests are witnessed. Once the system or equipment passes test­ing, it is verifie by designated commissioning official. 
(3) Customer Receives System. After all tests are com­pleted (including the "pull the plug" test), the system is turned over to the customer.

Informative Annex I Recommended Tightening Torque Tables from UL Standard 486A-B 
This informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document, but is included for informational pur­poses only. 
In the absence of connector or equipment manufacturer's recommended torque values, Table I.l, Table 1.2, and Table 
1.3 may be used to correctly tighten screw-type connections for power and lighting circuits*. Control and signal circuits may require different torque values, and the manufacturer should be contacted for guidance. 
Table 1.1 Tightening Torque for Screws 
*For proper termination of conductors, it is very impor­tant that fiel connections be properly tightened. In the absence of manufacturer's instructions on the equipment, the torque values given in these tables are recommended. Because it is normal for some relaxation to occur in ser­vice, checking torque values sometime after installation is not a reliable means of determining the values of torque applied at installation.
