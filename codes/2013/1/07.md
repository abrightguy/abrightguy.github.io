7-214. Suspension or revocation of certification. <
(a) A hospital inspector of record certification, issued by the Office, may be suspended or revoked, as determined by the Office. A certification may be suspended if: (a) the Office determines that one or more grounds for revocation exist and the immediate suspension of a certification is necessary for health and safety reasons, or (b) the Office determines that the suspension of a certification is appropriate based upon the evidence presented. Revocation of certification may occur when the Office determines that reasonable grounds exist.
The Office field staff or third parties may propose the suspension/revocation of a certification to the Office based on evidence of a certificate holder's misrepresentation(s), incompetence and/or malfeasance consistent with these regulations. The Office shall investigate the alleged misconduct of the certificate holder, gather evidence related to the incident(s) in question, and interview witnesses, if appropriate. Based upon consideration of the evidence presented, the Office shall determine whether or not reasonable grounds exist for the suspension/revocation of certification.
In the event that the Office determines that reasonable grounds exist for suspension/revocation, the Office will provide the certificate holder in question with an opportunity to participate in a formal interview and/or present additional evidence before a final determination is made. A formal interview may be conducted in person or by telephone. The Office shall make a final determination as to the suspension/revocation after considering all of the evidence on record, including the formal interview and/or any additional information submitted by the certificate holder. Written notification of the Office's final determination will be provided to the certificate holder within 15 days.
(b) Suspension is appropriate when: 1) a certificate holder negligently commits an act amounting to one or more grounds of revocation; 2) a certificate holder acts with negligence/incompetence in the performance of inspection duties; 3) the evidence demonstrates a single or isolated incident rather than a course of negligent/incompetent conduct on the part of the certificate holder in question; and/or 4) the Office determines that other factors, including but not limited to mitigating circumstances or facts relating to the certificate holder's course of conduct, support the suspension of certification in lieu of revocation.
A certification may be suspended for a minimum of one month to a maximum of eighteen months. The duration of suspension will be determined by the Office upon consideration of all of the evidence on record, and account for the severity of the action(s) constituting grounds for suspension.
(c)
Revocation is appropriate when: 1) a certificate holder knowingly or willfully commits an act amounting to one or more grounds for revocation; 2) a certificate holder acts with gross negligence/incompetence in the performance of inspection duties; 3) the evidence demonstrates a history of repeated or continuous deviations from the general standard of care in the inspection industry; and/or 4) the Office determines that other factors, including but not limited to damages to third parties or facts related to the certificate holder's course ofconduct, justify the revocation of the certification.

(d)
Appeal of any suspension or revocation by the certificate holder may be made to the Hospital Building Safety Board pursuant to Article 5 of these regulations, including an expedited appeal as described in Section 7-173.
